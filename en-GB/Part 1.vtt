00:19:28.887 --> 00:19:30.389
Saying things...

00:19:32.643 --> 00:19:36.867
It's hard to make out, but he told me
to cleanse the Control Point.

00:19:37.131 --> 00:19:38.571
Push the Hiss out.

00:19:39.677 --> 00:19:41.677
The whole room shifted around.

00:19:41.881 --> 00:19:43.561
- EMILY: You did that?

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:48.747
And you entered the building when it's already
in the lockdown. Before you became the new director?

00:19:48.847 --> 00:19:50.113
How?

00:19:50.625 --> 00:19:52.918 line:0%
- JESSE: <i>I'm not ready
to tell her about you yet.</i>

00:19:52.799 --> 00:19:54.447
A janitor let me in.

00:19:54.962 --> 00:19:59.255
- EMILY: (SCOFFS) I love it!
This is fucking unbelievable! It's...

00:19:59.452 --> 00:20:01.625
I can't even...

00:20:01.942 --> 00:20:06.184
(SCOFFS) Look, Jesse.
I have a million questions and...

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:08.776
You probably have a million more.

<i>Not yet.</i>

00:20:14.821 --> 00:20:18.211
- EMILY: But there's something
I need to ask you to do first.

00:20:18.265 --> 00:20:20.928
If you can cleanse a Control Point...

00:20:20.968 --> 00:20:26.654
...then you can maybe cure those infected
...or possessed by the Hiss.

00:20:26.949 --> 00:20:28.882
Because if that's possible...

00:20:28.933 --> 00:20:32.272
...our options are very different.

I've blamed for what happened to me for so long.</i>

00:20:47.342 --> 00:20:49.809 line:0%

00:20:50.177 --> 00:20:51.177
Yes.

00:20:52.137 --> 00:20:53.137
I can try.

00:21:05.566 --> 00:21:07.099
<i>We did it before.</i>

00:21:07.192 --> 00:21:09.305
<i>Push the Hiss out.</i>

00:21:12.268 --> 00:21:15.627
(EFFORT GRUNT)

00:21:19.863 --> 00:21:21.223
Come on, come on!

00:21:33.555 --> 00:21:34.941
<i>It didn't work.</i>

00:21:34.981 --> 00:21:37.474
<i>The Hiss has burrowed too deep.</i>

00:21:37.654 --> 00:21:40.774
<i>Ripping it out rips them apart.</i>

00:21:42.218 --> 00:21:43.818
I can't clease them.

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:45.200
- EMILY: I saw.

00:21:45.791 --> 00:21:49.431
It was worth the shot.
Thank you, Director... Jesse!

00:21:53.815 --> 00:21:56.388
- JESSE: <i>I'm gonna tell her why I'm here.</i>

00:21:56.535 --> 00:21:58.002
<i>I'll risk it.</i>

00:21:58.061 --> 00:21:59.061
Listen.

00:21:59.768 --> 00:22:02.114
The bureau was involved in an...

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:05.433
...incident in my hometown, Ordinary.

00:22:05.784 --> 00:22:07.570
17 years ago.

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:11.386
The bureau came in
and covered the whole thing up.

00:22:12.147 --> 00:22:15.219
I've been looking for this place
for a long time.

00:22:15.935 --> 00:22:17.374 line:0%
<i>That's enough.</i>

00:22:18.025 --> 00:22:20.025 line:0%
<i>Maybe that's too much already.</i>

<i>I can't tell her about Dylan
and the rest yet.</i>

00:22:24.895 --> 00:22:30.015
- EMILY: I've seen mentions of
an Altered World Event case dealing with Ordinary.

00:22:30.812 --> 00:22:33.644
You were at Ground Zero as a child?

00:22:34.602 --> 00:22:38.232
It was one of the big ones before my time.

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:41.689
And very classified.

00:22:41.732 --> 00:22:44.830
I can try to dig out some old files for you.

00:22:44.943 --> 00:22:48.335
My boss, Casper Darling, would know but...

00:22:48.389 --> 00:22:50.048
He's missing.

00:22:50.395 --> 00:22:53.914
I think he knew this was coming or suspected.

00:22:54.349 --> 00:22:57.779
He came up with the HRAs,
the Hedron Resonance Amplifers.

00:22:57.841 --> 00:23:00.460
I think they're what saved us, or...

00:23:00.747 --> 00:23:02.364
...a few of us.

00:23:02.704 --> 00:23:04.737
And director Trench would know.

00:23:04.764 --> 00:23:06.044
- JESSE: Trench.

00:23:06.241 --> 00:23:09.640
The ghost... or... whatever he is...

00:23:10.067 --> 00:23:12.867
He mentioned something called the Hotline.

00:23:13.339 --> 00:23:15.264
Said I should find it.

00:23:15.902 --> 00:23:18.782
It's another Object of Power like the gun.

00:23:18.382 --> 00:23:20.430
An old Bakelite telephone.

00:23:20.537 --> 00:23:24.804
A direct line of communication
between the director and the Board.

00:23:24.844 --> 00:23:27.697
Maybe he can talk to you
more clearly through that.

00:23:27.786 --> 00:23:31.387
I mean, Trench had years and years of experience.

00:23:31.448 --> 00:23:34.220
He might know how to destroy the Hiss.

00:23:34.837 --> 00:23:36.661
- JESSE: Where is the Hotline?

00:23:36.867 --> 00:23:39.713
- EMILY: It's kept in the Communication Department,
through the Mail Room.

00:23:39.434 --> 00:23:43.170
It's part of this sector so we can access it
even with the lockdown in place.

00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:45.192
We'll get the door open for you.

00:23:45.352 --> 00:23:48.073
- JESSE: Okay. That's my next stop.

00:23:48.668 --> 00:23:52.636
- EMILY: That Tommasi's department.
He's the Head of Communications.

00:23:52.507 --> 00:23:54.919
I don't think he had an HRA.

00:23:54.347 --> 00:23:57.453
He kinda made a point
about not wearing one earlier.

00:23:57.484 --> 00:23:59.103
Keep an eye out.

00:24:02.451 --> 00:24:04.570
- JESSE: <i>They called me The Director.</i>

00:24:04.611 --> 00:24:06.685
(SCOFFS) That's not me.

00:24:06.806 --> 00:24:08.553
I'm not a director type.

00:24:08.634 --> 00:24:10.028
Not a leader.

00:24:12.115 --> 00:24:14.081
Why am I here?

00:24:14.539 --> 00:24:16.687
I think you already know.

00:24:17.493 --> 00:24:22.017
Yes, I came for my brother
but there <i>are</i> other reasons too.

00:24:22.132 --> 00:24:27.051
I said I was looking for answers
but I might never understand them.

00:24:27.988 --> 00:24:32.672
I'm not looking for proof.
This is already it, more than enough.

00:24:33.658 --> 00:24:38.932
No matter what they told me
all those years, I know it's real now.

00:24:40.225 --> 00:24:42.468
I didn't imagine this.

00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:45.463
I wanna be a part of this world.

00:24:47.306 --> 00:24:50.852
What scares me shitless
is that I finally found it.

00:24:51.699 --> 00:24:55.152
Only to see the Hiss destroy it all.

00:24:56.026 --> 00:24:58.599
(PHONE RINGS)

00:25:01.411 --> 00:25:03.890
(PHONE RINGS)

00:25:06.658 --> 00:25:09.409

00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:14.870
(PHONE RINGS)

00:25:17.709 --> 00:25:20.412
(PHONE RINGS)

00:25:21.985 --> 00:25:26.254
- EMILY: I know this is all new to you.
So don't hesitate to ask me anything you wanna know.

00:25:26.321 --> 00:25:28.666
There are <i>no</i> stupid questions.

00:25:28.997 --> 00:25:30.905
The door to the Comms Department is...

00:25:31.609 --> 00:25:35.129
The Hotline should be
in the Communications Department.

00:25:37.792 --> 00:25:39.944
- JESSE: Where does the Hiss come from?

00:25:39.762 --> 00:25:43.115
- EMILY: I'm not sure. You said
the Hiss was here when you entered.

00:25:42.888 --> 00:25:46.408
Did you see anything like that outside
before you came in?

00:25:46.694 --> 00:25:49.511
- JESSE: No, no just inside.

00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:52.457
- EMILY: The source is internal then.

00:25:52.523 --> 00:25:58.497
The Oldest House is the sprawling complex
with... openings to other places as well.

00:25:58.759 --> 00:26:01.176
I don't even know where to start looking.

00:26:01.254 --> 00:26:04.710
But in the context, it's good news.
The lockdown holds.

00:26:04.550 --> 00:26:07.365
The Hiss escaping the building would be the end.

00:26:07.113 --> 00:26:09.905
Pretty shitty world out there
if you ask me but...

00:26:09.719 --> 00:26:11.877
I wouldn't want the Hiss to destroy it.

00:26:11.625 --> 00:26:14.091
- JESSE: With you on that, Emily.

00:26:17.229 --> 00:26:19.695
You mentioned the Oldest House.

00:26:20.115 --> 00:26:21.321
What is it?

00:26:21.557 --> 00:26:26.320
- EMILY: This building, the bureau headquarters,
the Oldest House, is a shifting place.

00:26:26.594 --> 00:26:30.040
You've seen it,
it transcends its physical limits.

00:26:30.244 --> 00:26:33.590
- JESSE: I've been to New York a few times...

00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:36.244
How didn't I notice this place?

00:26:36.475 --> 00:26:38.570
- EMILY: It's an attribute of the building.

00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:40.230
This is the place of power.

00:26:40.050 --> 00:26:44.385
The Oldest House doesn't like attention so
unless you're purposedly try to find it, you don't.

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:46.240
Which is perfect for us.

00:26:46.393 --> 00:26:49.799
The work we do here is essential but...

00:26:49.850 --> 00:26:51.013
...unstable.

00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:54.010
The bureau prefers not to be noticed.

00:26:54.095 --> 00:26:57.083
And we need strong walls to make sure
nothing gets out.

00:26:57.126 --> 00:27:00.833 line:0%
- JESSE: <i>So without you,
I never would've found the front door.</i>

00:27:01.198 --> 00:27:02.198
Okay.

00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:06.603
This Trench guy...

00:27:06.657 --> 00:27:08.949
I keep hearing him in my head.

00:27:09.318 --> 00:27:10.930
Is he a ghost...

00:27:11.198 --> 00:27:12.398
...haunting me?

00:27:13.399 --> 00:27:17.213
- EMILY: I doubt we're talking about
ghosts in a traditional sense...

00:27:17.067 --> 00:27:18.747
...but an echo, maybe.

00:27:18.853 --> 00:27:22.245
See, if he was killed
by the Service Weapon, your gun.

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:26.142
Maybe it's his final thought recoded
by the bullet in his brain, like a...

00:27:26.173 --> 00:27:28.773
...a deep space probe's
sending back data.

00:27:29.227 --> 00:27:33.259
That's just a hypothesis on my part
I need the gun to research it.

00:27:33.075 --> 00:27:36.725
(CHUCKLES) But... you better hold on to that
given the circumstances.

00:27:36.805 --> 00:27:38.485
- JESSE: I think I will.

00:27:39.205 --> 00:27:40.205
Yeah.

00:27:42.557 --> 00:27:46.452
Can you tell me what
an Object of Power is, exactly?

00:27:46.718 --> 00:27:47.838
This is all...

00:27:48.491 --> 00:27:50.330
Well... new to me.

00:27:50.661 --> 00:27:53.627
- EMILY: (CHUCKLES) Don't worry.
I love going over the basics.

00:27:53.453 --> 00:27:57.767
So Objects of Power are mundane objects
that have paranatural energies.

00:27:57.594 --> 00:28:00.813
...and have developed a link to the Astral Plane
and can thus be controlled.

00:28:00.644 --> 00:28:05.352
Which is what differentiates them from Altered Items
which are still housings of paranatural forces...

00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:09.922
But are more volitale and cannot be bound
in the parautilitarian sense.

00:28:10.068 --> 00:28:11.068
Got it?

00:28:11.221 --> 00:28:13.958 line:0%
- JESSE: <i>Did she memorise this?</i>

00:28:15.258 --> 00:28:16.258
Got it.

00:28:16.632 --> 00:28:17.632
Thanks.

00:28:20.558 --> 00:28:23.991
So HRAs stop you from becoming Hiss.

00:28:24.091 --> 00:28:26.003
- EMILY: It seems that way.

00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:31.309
I hadn't even heard of an HRA until a few weeks ago
when Dr. Darling started handing them out.

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:33.701
Well, I began analysing mine as soon as I got it.

00:28:33.528 --> 00:28:40.022
And each one, it seems to emit a powerful
short range frequency way beyond anything I've ever seen.

00:28:40.322 --> 00:28:43.427
- JESSE: Doesn't the timing seem suspicious?

00:28:44.125 --> 00:28:45.906
- EMILY: I thought that too.

00:28:45.955 --> 00:28:50.965
Dr. Darling usually likes to unveil
his latest breakthrough in big presentations.

00:28:51.032 --> 00:28:53.942
With these, he just passed them out.

00:28:54.163 --> 00:28:58.340
His behaviour makes me wonder
what exactly he knew.

00:29:02.427 --> 00:29:04.107
- JESSE: Thanks, Emily.

00:29:03.906 --> 00:29:06.432
I'm sure I'll have more questions soon.

00:29:06.459 --> 00:29:08.192
