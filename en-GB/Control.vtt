00:19:39.677 --> 00:19:41.677
The whole room shifted around.

00:19:41.881 --> 00:19:43.561
- EMILY: You did that?

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:48.747
And you entered the building when it's already
in the lockdown. Before you became the new director?

00:19:48.847 --> 00:19:50.113
How?

00:19:50.625 --> 00:19:52.918
- JESSE: <i>I'm not ready
to tell her about you yet.</i>

00:19:52.799 --> 00:19:54.447
A janitor let me in.

00:19:54.962 --> 00:19:59.255
- EMILY: (SCOFFS) I love it!
This is fucking unbelievable! It's...

00:19:59.452 --> 00:20:01.625
I can't even...

00:20:01.942 --> 00:20:06.184
(SCOFFS) Look, Jesse.
I have a million questions and...

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:08.776
You probably have a million more.

00:20:09.231 --> 00:20:12.131
- JESSE: <i>Like, do you know my brother Dylan?</i>

00:20:12.677 --> 00:20:14.183
<i>Not yet.</i>

00:20:14.821 --> 00:20:18.211
- EMILY: But there's something
I need to ask you to do first.

00:20:18.265 --> 00:20:20.928
If you can cleanse a Control Point...

00:20:20.968 --> 00:20:26.654
...then you can maybe cure those infected
...or possessed by the Hiss.

00:20:26.949 --> 00:20:28.882
Because if that's possible...

00:20:28.933 --> 00:20:32.272
...our options are very different.

00:20:33.123 --> 00:20:34.723
- JESSE: <i>Emily Pope.</i>

00:20:35.728 --> 00:20:38.461
<i>I don't know her. But I like her already.</i>

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:43.979
<i>She's the opposite of the faceless agents here
blamed for what happened to me for so long.</i>

00:20:45.248 --> 00:20:46.981
<i>But I can't trust her yet.</i>

00:20:47.342 --> 00:20:49.809
<i>Or rather the bureau she's a part of.</i>

00:20:50.177 --> 00:20:51.177
Yes.

00:20:52.137 --> 00:20:53.137
I can try.

00:20:55.093 --> 00:20:57.283
<i>I'm speaking for you, of course.</i>

00:20:57.723 --> 00:20:59.776
<i>We can try it together.</i>

00:21:02.566 --> 00:21:05.139
<i>Okay, you're with me?</i>

00:21:05.566 --> 00:21:07.099
<i>We did it before.</i>

00:21:07.192 --> 00:21:09.305
<i>Push the Hiss out.</i>

00:21:12.268 --> 00:21:15.627
(EFFORT GRUNT)

00:21:19.863 --> 00:21:21.223
Come on, come on!

00:21:33.555 --> 00:21:34.941
<i>It didn't work.</i>

00:21:34.981 --> 00:21:37.474
<i>The Hiss has burrowed too deep.</i>

00:21:37.654 --> 00:21:40.774
<i>Ripping it out rips them apart.</i>

00:21:42.218 --> 00:21:43.818
I can't clease them.

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:45.200
- EMILY: I saw.

00:21:45.791 --> 00:21:49.431
It was worth the shot.
Thank you, Director... Jesse!

00:21:53.815 --> 00:21:56.388
- JESSE: <i>I'm gonna tell her why I'm here.</i>

00:21:56.535 --> 00:21:58.002
<i>I'll risk it.</i>

00:21:58.061 --> 00:21:59.061
Listen.

00:21:59.768 --> 00:22:02.114
The bureau was involved in an...

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:05.433
...incident in my hometown, Ordinary.

00:22:05.784 --> 00:22:07.570
17 years ago.

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:11.386
The bureau came in
and covered the whole thing up.

00:22:12.147 --> 00:22:15.219
I've been looking for this place
for a long time.

00:22:15.935 --> 00:22:17.374
<i>That's enough.</i>

00:22:18.025 --> 00:22:20.025
<i>Maybe that's too much already.</i>

00:22:21.046 --> 00:22:24.615
<i>I can't tell her about Dylan
and the rest yet.</i>

00:22:24.895 --> 00:22:30.015
- EMILY: I've seen mentions of
an Altered World Event case dealing with Ordinary.

00:22:30.812 --> 00:22:33.644
You were at Ground Zero as a child?

00:22:34.602 --> 00:22:38.232
It was one of the big ones before my time.

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:41.689
And very classified.

00:22:41.732 --> 00:22:44.830
I can try to dig out some old files for you.

00:22:44.943 --> 00:22:48.335
My boss, Casper Darling, would know but...

00:22:48.389 --> 00:22:50.048
He's missing.

00:22:50.395 --> 00:22:53.914
I think he knew this was coming or suspected.

00:22:54.349 --> 00:22:57.779
He came up with the HRAs,
the Hedron Resonance Amplifers.

00:22:57.841 --> 00:23:00.460
I think ### us.

00:23:00.747 --> 00:23:02.364
A few of us.

00:23:02.704 --> 00:23:04.737
And director Trench would know.

00:23:04.764 --> 00:23:06.044
- JESSE: Trench.

00:23:06.241 --> 00:23:09.640
The ghost... or... whatever he is...

00:23:10.067 --> 00:23:12.867
He mentioned something called The Hotline.

00:23:13.339 --> 00:23:15.264
Said I should find it.

00:23:15.902 --> 00:23:18.782
It's another Object of Power like the gun.

00:23:18.382 --> 00:23:20.430
An old ### telephone.

00:23:20.537 --> 00:23:24.804
A direct line of communication
between the director and The Board.

00:23:24.844 --> 00:23:27.697
Maybe you can talk ### clearly through that.

00:23:27.786 --> 00:23:31.387
I mean, Trench had years and years of experience.

00:23:31.448 --> 00:23:34.220
He might know how to distroy the Hiss.

00:23:34.837 --> 00:23:36.661
- JESSE: Where is The Hotline?

00:23:36.867 --> 00:23:39.713
- EMILY: It's kept in the Communication Department,
through the Mail Room.

00:23:39.434 --> 00:23:43.170
It's part of the sector so we can access it
even with the lockdown in place.

00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:45.192
We'll get the door open for you.

00:23:45.352 --> 00:23:48.073
- JESSE: Okay. That's my next stop.

00:23:48.668 --> 00:23:52.636
- EMILY: That Tommasi's department.
He's the Head of Communications.

00:23:52.507 --> 00:23:54.919
I don't think he had an HRA.

00:23:54.347 --> 00:23:57.453
He kinda made a point
about not wearing one earlier.

00:23:57.484 --> 00:23:59.103
Keep an eye out.

00:24:02.451 --> 00:24:04.570
- JESSE: <i>They called me The Director.</i>

00:24:04.611 --> 00:24:06.685
(SCOFFS) That's not me.

00:24:06.806 --> 00:24:08.553
I'm not a director-type.

00:24:08.634 --> 00:24:10.028
Not a leader.

00:24:12.115 --> 00:24:14.081
Why am I here?

00:24:14.539 --> 00:24:16.687
I think you already know.

00:24:17.493 --> 00:24:22.017
Yes, I came for my brother
but there <i>are</i> other reasons too.

00:24:22.132 --> 00:24:27.051
I said I was looking for answers
but I might never understand them.

00:24:27.988 --> 00:24:32.672
I'm not looking for proof.
This ### already is more than enough.

00:24:33.658 --> 00:24:38.932
No matter what they told me
all those years, I know it's real now.

00:24:40.225 --> 00:24:42.468
I didn't imagine this.

00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:45.463
I wanna be a part of this world.

00:24:47.306 --> 00:24:50.852
What scares me shitless
is that I finally found it.

00:24:51.699 --> 00:24:55.152
Only to see the Hiss destroy it all.

00:24:56.026 --> 00:24:58.599
(PHONE RINGS)

00:25:01.411 --> 00:25:03.890
(PHONE RINGS)

00:25:06.658 --> 00:25:09.409
(PHONE RINGS)

00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:14.870
(PHONE RINGS)

00:25:17.709 --> 00:25:20.412
(PHONE RINGS)

00:25:21.985 --> 00:25:26.254
- EMILY: I know this is all new to you.
So don't hesitate to ask me anything you wanna know.

00:25:26.321 --> 00:25:28.666
There are <i>no</i> stupid questions.

00:25:28.997 --> 00:25:30.905
The door to the Comms Department is...

00:25:31.609 --> 00:25:35.129
The Hotline should be
in the Communications Department.

00:25:37.792 --> 00:25:39.944
- JESSE: Where does the Hiss come from?

00:25:39.762 --> 00:25:43.115
- EMILY: I'm not sure. You said
the Hiss was here when you entered.

00:25:42.888 --> 00:25:46.408
Did you see anything like that outside
before you came in?

00:25:46.694 --> 00:25:49.511
- JESSE: No, no just inside.

00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:52.457
- EMILY: The source is internal then.

00:25:52.523 --> 00:25:58.497
The Oldest House is the sprawling complex
### opening to other places as well.

00:25:58.759 --> 00:26:01.176
I don't even know where to start looking.

00:26:01.254 --> 00:26:04.710
But in the context, it's good news.
The lockdown holds.

00:26:04.550 --> 00:26:07.365
The Hiss escaping the building would be the end.

00:26:07.113 --> 00:26:09.905
Pretty shitty world out there
if you ask me but...

00:26:09.719 --> 00:26:11.877
I wouldn't want the Hiss to destroy it.

00:26:11.625 --> 00:26:14.091
- JESSE: I'm with you on that, Emily.

00:26:17.229 --> 00:26:19.695
You mentioned the Oldest House.

00:26:20.115 --> 00:26:21.321
What is it?
