00:00:11.202 --> 00:00:17.165
- EMILY: The resonance emitted from the HRA
is purely ### every variant of the Hiss ###.

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:21.609
- JESSE: <i>It's happening!</i>

00:00:21.373 --> 00:00:24.899
<i>After all these years, Dylan is here!</i>

00:00:26.137 --> 00:00:27.960
<i>But am I too late?</i>

00:00:28.591 --> 00:00:30.128
How is he?

00:00:30.893 --> 00:00:32.093
I need to know.

00:00:32.673 --> 00:00:37.715
- EMILY: He's clearly been affected by the Hiss,
but it's different from any other manifestation we've ever recorded.

00:00:37.743 --> 00:00:40.454
Maybe what makes you so special
is genetic.

00:00:40.601 --> 00:00:42.192
He was a Prime Candidate.

00:00:42.232 --> 00:00:46.809
Or maybe it's Polaris protecting him
something else affecting situation.

00:00:47.608 --> 00:00:49.412
I need to run tests.

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:50.791
He seems...

00:00:50.914 --> 00:00:54.011
...more in control, more present!

00:00:54.442 --> 00:00:56.242
- JESSE: I want to see him.

00:00:56.557 --> 00:00:58.154
<i>My brother!</i>

00:00:58.676 --> 00:01:00.453
<i>Or is he?</i>

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.850
- EMILY: Of course.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.692
Marshal has set up an HRA ### cage
to contain him. It's on the upper floor, up the stairs.

00:01:07.771 --> 00:01:09.520
- JESSE: Okay, I need to go.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.800
- EMILY: Jesse!

00:01:11.797 --> 00:01:13.163
Be careful.
