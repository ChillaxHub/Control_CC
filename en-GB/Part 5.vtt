antithetical to every variant of the Hiss signal I can arrange.

00:00:17.173 --> 00:00:19.173

How is he?

00:00:30.893 --> 00:00:32.093
I need to know.

00:00:32.673 --> 00:00:37.715
- EMILY: He's clearly been affected by the Hiss,
but it's different than any other manifestation we've ever recorded.

00:00:37.743 --> 00:00:40.454
Maybe what makes you so special
is genetic.

00:00:40.601 --> 00:00:42.192
He was a Prime Candidate.

00:00:42.232 --> 00:00:46.809
Or maybe it's Polaris, protecting him?
Something else affecting situation?

00:00:47.608 --> 00:00:49.412
I need to run tests.

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:50.791
He seems...

00:00:50.914 --> 00:00:54.011
...more in control, more present!

00:00:54.442 --> 00:00:56.242

- EMILY: Of course.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.692
Marshal set up an HRA warded cage
to contain him. It's on the upper floor, up the stairs.

00:01:07.771 --> 00:01:09.520
- JESSE: Okay, I need to go.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.800

- DYLAN: Not Dylan.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.179
Trench and Darling made sure of that.

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.296
I'm P6.

00:02:47.483 --> 00:02:50.349
P... 6.

00:02:50.676 --> 00:02:52.764
But I'm better now.

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.401
The Hiss made me better.

00:02:55.798 --> 00:02:58.975
(IN DISTORTED VOICE) Push the fingers
through the surface into the wet.

00:02:59.005 --> 00:03:00.985
You've always been the new.

00:03:01.023 --> 00:03:02.589
You want this to be true.

They make me feel good.

- DYLAN: (IN NORMAL VOICE)
We found Polaris together with my sister.

00:03:55.957 --> 00:03:58.589
When we were very small.

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.682
In Ordinary.

00:04:01.282 --> 00:04:06.701
In the desert... Through the door
opened up by a Slide Projector...

00:04:08.322 --> 00:04:12.394
But she didn't help
when Trench took me away.

00:04:12.554 --> 00:04:15.427
She didn't give me any powers!

00:04:15.567 --> 00:04:19.288
All the powers are my own powers.

00:04:20.696 --> 00:04:25.542
And she didn't help
when they locked me up for years.

00:04:29.193 --> 00:04:32.271
(IN DISTORTED VOICE)
After the song, time for applause.

00:04:32.138 --> 00:04:34.382
We build you until nothing remains.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.259
The egg cracks and the truth
will emerge out of you.

00:04:36.948 --> 00:04:39.345
You are home.

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.787
(IN NORMAL VOICE) The bureau brought
the Slide Projector back here with me.

00:04:46.004 --> 00:04:49.743
And the bureau did what the bureau does.

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.915
They used it.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.286
And they found...

00:04:57.736 --> 00:05:00.650
...they opened the door up to the Hiss.

00:05:00.731 --> 00:05:03.830
That's the only thing
I can thank them for.

Baby, baby, baby, yeah.

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:25.278
Just plastic.

So, safe...

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.403

Funny.

00:05:34.978 --> 00:05:37.344
(IN NORMAL VOICE)
I welcomed the Hiss.

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:39.154
I let it in...

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.873
...to get rid of <i>her</i>.

00:05:41.913 --> 00:05:44.690
The Hiss set me free.

00:05:45.672 --> 00:05:47.984
Polaris is using you.

00:05:48.193 --> 00:05:50.610
The bureau is using you.

00:05:50.937 --> 00:05:53.156
You are a puppet!

00:05:53.615 --> 00:05:56.968

00:06:08.433 --> 00:06:10.114
Sister.

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:13.122
The horrible truth about the bureau.

00:06:13.209 --> 00:06:15.721
The Hiss is the better option.

00:06:15.888 --> 00:06:19.435
Go to the Prime Candidate Programme
in the Containment Sector.

00:06:19.476 --> 00:06:21.809
I have the keycard to get you there.

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:24.154

Okay, Dylan.

00:06:33.075 --> 00:06:34.374
I'll go.

00:06:34.996 --> 00:06:37.196

- DYLAN: (UNINTELLIGIBLE SPEAKING)

00:07:23.085 --> 00:07:25.064
- EMILY: How are you doing, Jesse?

00:07:24.905 --> 00:07:27.989
### can't be easy seeing Dylan like this.

00:07:28.202 --> 00:07:29.642
- JESSE: I'm fine!

00:07:30.091 --> 00:07:33.321
What can you tell me?
Is he stil...

00:07:35.072 --> 00:07:36.611
...human?

00:07:36.697 --> 00:07:38.730 line:0%
<i>Or is he Hiss?</i>

00:07:39.327 --> 00:07:43.423
- EMILY: I've taken numerous tissue samples
and have tests running as we speak but...

00:07:43.344 --> 00:07:45.765
From the initial data, he looks healthy.

00:07:45.806 --> 00:07:48.672
I only see corruption in a superficial way.

00:07:48.803 --> 00:07:50.736
- JESSE: What does that mean?

00:07:51.715 --> 00:07:54.119
- EMILY: I don't know.
This is all new.

00:07:54.144 --> 00:07:57.825
If he's like you, maybe Polaris
has prevented total Hiss take over.

00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:00.797
Or this is just a new form of Hiss.

00:08:00.924 --> 00:08:04.412
We've already seen how
it affects people in different ways.

00:08:04.465 --> 00:08:07.411
- JESSE: Dylan told me he let the Hiss in.

00:08:08.189 --> 00:08:10.168
Does that change anything?

00:08:11.403 --> 00:08:13.615
- EMILY: Voluntary conversion?

00:08:13.709 --> 00:08:17.447
I mean, hypothetically that could affect
the mental state post-corruption...

00:08:17.488 --> 00:08:20.691
...as well as the extent
of biological alteration.

00:08:21.029 --> 00:08:24.679
Again, this is new territory for me.
I'll need time.

00:08:24.772 --> 00:08:26.443
- JESSE: You won't have it!

00:08:26.501 --> 00:08:30.384
I'm gonna shut down the Slide Projector.
That's how the Hiss are getting in.

00:08:30.531 --> 00:08:32.217
Once I close it...

00:08:32.741 --> 00:08:34.541
...this should all be over.

00:08:35.735 --> 00:08:38.859
- EMILY: Jesse, we don't know how this works.

00:08:38.899 --> 00:08:43.904
If you severed their connections to the source
it could cause a terminal chain reaction

00:08:43.936 --> 00:08:47.681
<i>Every</i> Hiss-corrupted individuals... dead!

00:08:48.761 --> 00:08:51.661 line:0%
- JESSE: <i>Better that than what Dylan is now.</i>

00:08:52.177 --> 00:08:53.857
I'm shutting it down.

00:08:54.026 --> 00:08:55.845
This has to end.

00:08:56.438 --> 00:08:58.405
Whatever happens...

00:08:58.646 --> 00:09:00.265
...happens.

00:09:01.847 --> 00:09:04.791
- EMILY: Okay, just let me know
how I can help.

00:09:05.386 --> 00:09:07.119
- JESSE: Thank you, Emily.
