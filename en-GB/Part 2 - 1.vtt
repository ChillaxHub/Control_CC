Whatever's got into our buddies have them
wrecking cooling pumps and the power converters.

He was out of it

He's ranting about vunerabilities and how he only had
one "large scale HRA" but that he needed it somewhere else.

00:09:14.436 --> 00:09:17.786
Still, at least he gave us these
personal HRAs before he left.

00:09:17.812 --> 00:09:19.989

he was tearing his clothes off?

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:22.302

Well, that's catchy.

00:09:43.161 --> 00:09:48.601

Salvador, out there, could you please ask him what the plan is?

00:09:48.628 --> 00:09:50.901

- ARISH: Not much.
Only what I've seen.

00:10:14.695 --> 00:10:21.759
Well, they use the same tatics that Marshall and Salvador taught us which makes me think that the Hiss haven't completely erased the people inside which...

00:10:21.863 --> 00:10:24.122
...is a fucking horrible thought.

00:10:24.675 --> 00:10:27.654
Or they're just using whatever they find
in their victim's head.

00:10:27.747 --> 00:10:31.550
In any case, they are really eager
to get inside the power plant.

00:10:31.751 --> 00:10:34.017

00:10:33.786 --> 00:10:36.916

They wanna make my life harder?

00:10:38.397 --> 00:10:40.557

I make sure all the weird shit down here

00:10:45.292 --> 00:10:50.257

- ARISH: I love it!

00:10:53.626 --> 00:10:57.921
You know, everyone thinks that Maintenance is lowest rung
on the ladder just because we fix pipes instead of...

00:10:57.966 --> 00:10:59.503
...writing memos.

00:10:59.529 --> 00:11:03.381

what Salvador told me...

00:11:19.857 --> 00:11:22.563
...But I know it generates
all the electricity for the bureau.

00:11:22.603 --> 00:11:24.937
And it's got two very simple rules.

00:11:24.615 --> 00:11:27.245
Rule one, keep it below a certain temperature.

00:11:27.098 --> 00:11:30.171
Rule two, don't ever, ever open it.

00:11:30.224 --> 00:11:34.090
Oh, and three, uh... it's classified,
so I shouldn't ask.

00:11:34.305 --> 00:11:38.091

standard operating procedure around here.

It's all part of the job.

00:11:43.052 --> 00:11:45.631

00:11:45.651 --> 00:11:47.948
- ARISH: Not much.
That thing is director only.

00:11:48.008 --> 00:11:50.074
Salvador told me about the time
he saw Trench used it.

00:11:50.132 --> 00:11:52.991
Sounds like that gun can do
some serious damage.

00:11:53.125 --> 00:11:55.666
Yeah, I did see pictures of it once, though.
And uh...

00:11:55.693 --> 00:11:57.374
It looked different than
the thing you're carrying.

00:11:57.402 --> 00:11:59.434
You mod it or something?
It's new!

00:11:59.515 --> 00:12:02.218
- JESSE: Is new a good thing?

00:12:02.346 --> 00:12:05.940
- ARISH: Given the circumstances,
I'd say "new" is our best bet.

00:12:08.147 --> 00:12:10.481
- JESSE: Do you know this Ahti guy?

00:12:10.506 --> 00:12:13.948

He's my favourite coffee break buddy.
