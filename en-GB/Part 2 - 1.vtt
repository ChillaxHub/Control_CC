00:00:02.667 --> 00:00:05.675
The Maintenance Sector is the janitor's domain.

00:00:05.935 --> 00:00:10.948
If I can find Ahti here,
he can help me reach the override.

00:00:11.182 --> 00:00:15.752
Maybe it was you who got me into
the Oldest House when the lockdown's on.

00:00:15.885 --> 00:00:18.205
Maybe it was Ahti.

00:00:18.629 --> 00:00:23.365
It felt like he made the elevator appeared
that took me to Trench's office.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.507
Is Ahti guiding me too?

00:00:47.432 --> 00:00:51.272
The directorial override is right there.
In the Control Room.

00:00:51.887 --> 00:00:54.039
How do we get there?

00:02:51.924 --> 00:02:53.604
What's down that way?

00:02:59.218 --> 00:03:02.195
- AHTI: (SINGING)

00:03:18.112 --> 00:03:19.569
Well done!

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.427
You got the job.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.353
### for congratulations.

00:03:26.016 --> 00:03:27.936
###

00:03:28.527 --> 00:03:31.960
It happened in the last ###.

00:03:33.015 --> 00:03:36.645
I ### need an assistant.

00:03:37.176 --> 00:03:40.394
- JESSE: <i>Funny thing is...
I've been a janitor.</i>

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:43.772
<i>I'm more at home in that role
than in the director.</i>

00:03:44.875 --> 00:03:47.630
<i>Only Ahti here seems to see that.</i>

00:03:47.738 --> 00:03:50.747
Yeah, hi. Ahti, look...

00:03:50.976 --> 00:03:55.250
We need to get the lockdown lifted.
Otherwise, I can't get to the other sectors.

00:03:55.304 --> 00:03:57.412
Can you have me get to the override?

00:03:57.279 --> 00:04:00.722
- AHTI: Yes... yes... Easy peasy.

00:04:01.076 --> 00:04:03.377
It's just around the corner.

00:04:05.013 --> 00:04:06.698
But first...

00:04:07.065 --> 00:04:09.766
We need to get you working.
