Right, uh... Well, okay. Hello, I'm Federick Langston,
the Panopticon Supervisor.

00:09:16.334 --> 00:09:20.843
It's not the best time for a tour, we have Hiss everywhere
and numerous cell breaches.

00:09:20.892 --> 00:09:23.509
And system failures across the board but...

00:09:23.536 --> 00:09:26.821

00:09:35.259 --> 00:09:37.659
I was told Dylan Faden was kept here.

00:09:43.615 --> 00:09:46.800
Darling wanted him somewhere secured
and isolated away from people.

00:09:46.836 --> 00:09:49.410
He's in the maximum security cell
upper level.

00:09:49.457 --> 00:09:52.649
But there's currently a...
a pressing matter, ma'am.

00:09:52.516 --> 00:09:55.095
We've got an Object of Power loose in there.

00:09:55.122 --> 00:09:57.437
It's wrecking the place.
The Benicoff TV.

00:09:57.464 --> 00:10:00.201
It's a real doozy.

00:10:00.478 --> 00:10:04.218
Salvador took a team in to handle it
but no one has heard from them for hours.

00:10:04.359 --> 00:10:10.603
This is a category five OoP we're talking about.
If we don't contain it soon, it will tear the Panopticon apart.

00:10:10.637 --> 00:10:14.969

getting loose ma'am. No... trust me!

If you say so. Uh...

00:10:23.586 --> 00:10:27.386
I usually tell first timers
not to touch anything so uh...

00:10:27.426 --> 00:10:28.761
Just do that.

- LANGSTON: Sure. I mean, yeah...

00:10:56.666 --> 00:11:01.004

than I were over the postal service.

00:11:23.302 --> 00:11:24.893
- LANGSTON: It depends on the item.

Each one has different needs.

00:11:26.324 --> 00:11:28.857

- JESSE: What's the difference between
Objects of Power and Altered Items?

00:11:42.945 --> 00:11:45.364
- LANGSTON: Think of them like storms.

00:11:44.764 --> 00:11:47.930
Objects of Power are like tropical cyclones.

00:11:47.731 --> 00:11:50.308
Or hurricane for the uneducated.

00:11:50.348 --> 00:11:52.922
They're big, rare, and scary.

00:11:53.016 --> 00:11:57.592
Of course, the directors can just bind the OoP
and become the eye of the storm.

00:11:57.761 --> 00:12:00.819
Altered Items are more like
weird thunderstorms.

00:12:00.527 --> 00:12:03.237
Some may rain frogs, some may rain corns.

00:12:03.277 --> 00:12:05.144
But they all rain something.

00:12:05.326 --> 00:12:07.950
- JESSE: And how does the Hiss
factor into all that?

00:12:07.975 --> 00:12:10.438
- LANGSTON: It's changing them.
Making them aggressive.

00:12:10.234 --> 00:12:13.291
Now they're all raining...
I don't know... knives.

00:12:13.332 --> 00:12:15.004

Did you work closely with Trench?

00:12:22.309 --> 00:12:25.126
- LANGSTON: Uh... He spent most of his time
with Darling and all them.

00:12:24.979 --> 00:12:27.625
The inner circle.
Not that I care.

00:12:27.666 --> 00:12:30.269 line:0%
- JESSE: <i>Trench certainly had his favourites.</i>

00:12:30.296 --> 00:12:33.527
- LANGSTON: He did stop in occasionally
to scowl and smoke.

00:12:33.581 --> 00:12:36.371
Did you know that the bureau
has a no smoking policy?

00:12:36.439 --> 00:12:37.722
It does.

00:12:37.763 --> 00:12:39.363
Just not for Trench.

00:12:39.704 --> 00:12:43.551
Still, he is the one who put aside
funding for the Panopticon.

00:12:43.652 --> 00:12:46.124
The man did have vision.

- JESSE: How did you get this job?

00:12:50.922 --> 00:12:53.593
- LANGSTON: Started it as a junior agent.
Because my uncle knew a guy.

00:12:53.716 --> 00:13:00.363
From there I got put on a desk until an accident
left the Containment Sector serverely understaffed...

00:13:00.436 --> 00:13:02.637

I got bumped up to management.
