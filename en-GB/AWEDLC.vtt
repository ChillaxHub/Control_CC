00:48:24.025 --> 00:48:25.145
<i>Tear it apart.</i>

00:48:25.198 --> 00:48:26.531

- WAKE: I've forgotten again.

00:49:56.305 --> 00:49:57.958
I had a plan.

00:49:59.855 --> 00:50:01.088
I know it!

00:50:03.501 --> 00:50:04.909
I've forgotten.

00:50:24.962 --> 00:50:25.962
He's coming!

00:50:28.372 --> 00:50:30.172
I've gotta get out of here.

00:50:34.230 --> 00:50:35.350
Dive deeper.

he clearly needs some help.</i>

00:51:57.357 --> 00:52:01.555

something special.</i>

Something to convey an alien force,

00:52:37.776 --> 00:52:40.182
- JESSE: <i>Another replica.</i>

00:52:40.333 --> 00:52:42.733
<i>Like the one they made for Ordinary.</i>

00:52:43.129 --> 00:52:44.809
This is the director.

00:52:44.533 --> 00:52:47.433
I need a ranger
at this location immediately.

00:53:31.368 --> 00:53:33.048

00:53:33.923 --> 00:53:35.603

00:53:37.959 --> 00:53:39.869
Now it's my turn!

Langston was right!

00:53:43.976 --> 00:53:46.775 position:0% size:50%
You are pretty rough
on the eyes, Dr. Hartman.

00:55:31.547 --> 00:55:34.447
Hartman won't be
a problem anymore, Langston.

00:55:35.505 --> 00:55:38.740
But Investigations
needs someone to run it.

00:55:39.598 --> 00:55:40.598
Interested?

00:55:40.848 --> 00:55:43.492
- LANGSTON: I've seen what happens
to sector heads, ma'am.

00:55:43.572 --> 00:55:44.692
No, thank you.

00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:53.212
Ma'am, I'm getting something on my terminal here.
An AWE alert from Bright Falls, Washington.

00:55:53.283 --> 00:55:57.467
But it might be a glitch. The date's all wrong.
Couple of years in the future.

00:55:57.547 --> 00:56:01.058
And we're in lockdown,
there shouldn't be any incoming signals.

00:56:01.091 --> 00:56:04.739
- JESSE: Maybe it was active
before we went into lockdown?

00:56:05.863 --> 00:56:07.543
Are there agents onsite?

00:56:07.843 --> 00:56:09.395
- LANGSTON: Let me check.

00:56:09.503 --> 00:56:13.620 position:0% size:50%
Agent Estevez is the field agent
in charge of monitoring the site.

00:56:12.994 --> 00:56:18.017 position:100% size:50%
She should be there to let us know if the situation
has been through any major changes recently.

00:56:34.739 --> 00:56:36.878
- WAKE: Things set in motion.

00:56:37.005 --> 00:56:41.052
If the alarm's true, then
so is the reason for the alarm.

00:56:41.185 --> 00:56:44.110
The effect must follow the cause.

00:56:44.764 --> 00:56:46.507
It's happening again.

00:56:46.827 --> 00:56:48.471
A return.
