00:00:12.206 --> 00:00:15.057
- JESSE: Had to take
a detour into the quarry but...

00:00:15.084 --> 00:00:17.086
I found plenty.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:18.961
Here.

00:00:20.203 --> 00:00:23.613
- MARSHAL: We will start
HRA production immediately.

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.019
I promised I tell you about Dylan
once you helped us.

00:00:28.064 --> 00:00:29.854
- JESSE: <i>This is it!</i>

00:00:30.508 --> 00:00:32.081
<i>She knows.</i>

00:00:32.696 --> 00:00:35.949
<i>17 years avoided.</i>

00:00:36.234 --> 00:00:38.396
- MARSHAL: Your brother is here.

00:00:38.704 --> 00:00:41.407
He was once known as Prime Candidate 6.

00:00:41.167 --> 00:00:43.064
Code name "P6."

00:00:43.091 --> 00:00:46.010
We brought him here
after the Ordinary event.

00:00:46.157 --> 00:00:48.668
He was ### to be the future director.

00:00:48.708 --> 00:00:52.292
He has talent far beyond
any other candidates in the programme.

00:00:52.749 --> 00:00:54.940
- JESSE: <i>Of course, he did.</i>

00:00:55.671 --> 00:00:59.547
<i>We found you together, we share a bond.</i>

00:01:01.864 --> 00:01:03.847
<i>Are you with him now?</i>

00:01:04.041 --> 00:01:05.862
So you "kidnapped" him?

00:01:05.995 --> 00:01:08.080
- MARSHAL: We <i>took</i> him in.

00:01:08.132 --> 00:01:11.911
Your parents vanished along with
every other adults in Ordinary.

00:01:12.059 --> 00:01:14.744
Eventually, his power changed him.

00:01:14.858 --> 00:01:16.538
There were casualities.

00:01:16.555 --> 00:01:18.763
He wasn't fit to be the director.

00:01:18.844 --> 00:01:20.741
- JESSE: <i>Did you know about this?</i>

00:01:20.767 --> 00:01:24.522
<i>Is this why you didn't bring me here sooner?
Were you keeping me away?</i>

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.651
Where is Dylan?

00:01:26.821 --> 00:01:30.123
- MARSHAL: He's kept in the Containment Sector.
In the Panopticon.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.880
- JESSE: <i>My brother...</i>

00:01:32.946 --> 00:01:35.167
<i>I thought we were the same.</i>

00:01:36.316 --> 00:01:38.159
<i>What if we are?</i>

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:40.339
I'm going.

00:01:41.073 --> 00:01:42.265
Now.

00:01:42.466 --> 00:01:44.466
- MARSHAL: I expected as much.

00:01:44.627 --> 00:01:46.760
I need to go check on something.

00:01:46.801 --> 00:01:49.486
Something I cannot let the Hiss find.

00:01:49.767 --> 00:01:51.767
It shouldn't take long, but...

00:01:51.537 --> 00:01:54.437
...you must watch the bureau while I'm gone.

00:01:54.921 --> 00:01:56.300
And remember...

00:01:56.367 --> 00:01:58.624
Dylan is dangerous.

00:01:59.702 --> 00:02:03.061
Do <i>not</i> let him out, director Faden.

00:02:03.161 --> 00:02:06.418
- JESSE: <i>How do I make her
stop calling me that?</i>

00:02:06.603 --> 00:02:08.966
<i>I'm not here for them.</i>

00:02:10.057 --> 00:02:12.368
<i>Nothing's simple here.</i>

00:02:12.592 --> 00:02:15.699
<i>These people took my brother but...</i>

00:02:15.753 --> 00:02:18.517
<i>They accepted me without question.</i>

00:02:18.948 --> 00:02:23.167
<i>Are they my enemies or... my friends?</i>

00:02:24.855 --> 00:02:26.883
<i>I need to see Dylan.</i>

00:02:27.252 --> 00:02:29.169
<i>I need to know.</i>

00:02:31.632 --> 00:02:35.981
<i>I wish you could tell me what you know.
Explain things.</i>

00:02:36.168 --> 00:02:37.324
<i>Just...</i>

00:02:37.378 --> 00:02:39.584
<i>Just stay with me, okay?</i>

00:02:43.503 --> 00:02:45.850
<i>I could use a friend right now.</i>
