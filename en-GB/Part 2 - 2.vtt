WEBVTT

00:00:10.828 --> 00:00:15.180
- EMILY: Jesse! You made it!
And you've lifted the internal lockdown.

00:00:16.496 --> 00:00:18.428
- JESSE: Listen, Emily...

00:00:20.404 --> 00:00:23.061
<i>(SIGHS) Screw it, just tell her.</i>

00:00:23.765 --> 00:00:26.785
I haven't been completely honest.

00:00:28.242 --> 00:00:29.922
I have a younger brother.

00:00:30.101 --> 00:00:31.280
Dylan.

00:00:31.993 --> 00:00:36.551
When we were kids, we found
an old slide projector in Ordinary landfill.

00:00:36.858 --> 00:00:39.208
This slide created...

00:00:40.154 --> 00:00:42.745
...doorways to other places.

00:00:44.622 --> 00:00:46.441
Bad things happened.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.010
...came through.

00:00:50.118 --> 00:00:51.718
<i>That's all she gets.</i>

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.959
<i>The rest stays locked inside.</i>

00:00:56.514 --> 00:00:57.954
But we found help.

00:00:59.113 --> 00:01:03.530
Through one of the doorway, we...
met something.

00:01:05.545 --> 00:01:07.091
A being.

00:01:08.077 --> 00:01:09.437
- EMILY: A being?

00:01:09.688 --> 00:01:11.411
What kind of being?

00:01:11.838 --> 00:01:14.803
- JESSE: It's hard to describe, but it...

00:01:16.443 --> 00:01:18.327
<i>She</i> helped us.

00:01:19.187 --> 00:01:21.720
We managed to turn that projector off.

00:01:22.018 --> 00:01:25.026
The bad things that
came through the doorways...

00:01:25.464 --> 00:01:26.843
...were gone.

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.029
After that, your people came.

00:01:30.382 --> 00:01:31.988
Tried to grab us.

00:01:32.781 --> 00:01:34.074
I ran away.

00:01:36.222 --> 00:01:37.422
They got Dylan.

00:01:38.285 --> 00:01:39.938
<i>I left him behind.</i>

00:01:40.393 --> 00:01:42.837
- EMILY: Bureau agents took your brother?

00:01:42.864 --> 00:01:43.904
- JESSE: Yes.

00:01:44.792 --> 00:01:46.312
They covered it up.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.266
No one believed me.

00:01:52.006 --> 00:01:53.932
I just wanna find Dylan.

00:01:54.565 --> 00:01:57.032
I've been looking for him ever since.

00:01:58.393 --> 00:02:00.670
- EMILY: What happened
to the slide projector?

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.310
It sounds like another Object of Power.

00:02:03.851 --> 00:02:05.524
- JESSE: I thought you took it.

00:02:05.578 --> 00:02:06.971
...the bureau...

00:02:07.411 --> 00:02:09.091
...along, with Dylan.

00:02:09.721 --> 00:02:11.742
- EMILY: Nah, I've never heard of it.

00:02:11.816 --> 00:02:14.917
But around here, I assume
everything is classified.

00:02:15.017 --> 00:02:18.714
I looked into the Ordinary AWE case files
after you mentioned it...

00:02:18.741 --> 00:02:22.120
Trench and Darling were both involved.

00:02:22.742 --> 00:02:26.018
A large area of the Containment Sector
was preserved for it.

00:02:26.078 --> 00:02:31.642
The case says ### a long time.
I have no idea if anything's still there.

00:02:32.521 --> 00:02:36.391
Can you tell me more about
this being you found?

00:02:37.004 --> 00:02:39.538
- JESSE: <i>Let's hope you two get along.</i>

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.440
She's been with me ever since Ordinary.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:44.990
In my head.

00:02:46.183 --> 00:02:47.836
She led me to you.

00:02:49.316 --> 00:02:52.235
I call her... Polaris.

00:02:53.144 --> 00:02:55.627
- EMILY: As in a guiding star?

00:02:56.334 --> 00:02:59.033
Did Polaris know about the Hiss?

00:02:59.486 --> 00:03:02.838
If she got you in here
in spite of the lockdown.

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:05.573
She's very powerful.

00:03:06.641 --> 00:03:10.121
Which may help explain your test results.

00:03:10.272 --> 00:03:13.731
Your readings are incredible, Jesse!

00:03:13.931 --> 00:03:19.270
Cross referencing the database, I found two matches
in Darling's old classified files.

00:03:19.827 --> 00:03:23.579
Unfortunately, I can't access them beyond the file codes.

00:03:23.604 --> 00:03:29.208
But one was P6 refering to a Prime Candidate
for a potential future bureau director.

00:03:29.311 --> 00:03:31.384
This was lost years ago.

00:03:31.608 --> 00:03:34.354
- JESSE: <i>Dylan. Is that Dylan?</i>

00:03:35.062 --> 00:03:37.454
- EMILY: The other match
is on something called Hedron.

00:03:37.495 --> 00:03:41.552
Which must be connected to these
Hedron Resonance Amplifiers somehow.

00:03:41.605 --> 00:03:47.784
All I know is that Marshall went to the Research Sector
to secure the HRA production after the Hiss first attacked.

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:51.510
- JESSE: So Marshall seems like
our best lead on Dylan.

00:03:51.762 --> 00:03:53.442
I need to go after her.

00:03:53.737 --> 00:03:56.114
How can I get to the Research Sector?

00:03:56.212 --> 00:04:00.308
- EMILY: Use my keycard.
The Sector Elevator will take you there.

00:04:03.978 --> 00:04:06.312
- JESSE: <i>Marshall is the next step.</i>

00:04:07.076 --> 00:04:13.094
<i>What Emily told me, about Ordinary, my power
being connected to things in the bureau past.</i>

00:04:13.227 --> 00:04:15.828
<i>I am so close to something.</i>

00:04:17.788 --> 00:04:19.393
<i>Do you feel it?</i>

00:04:20.347 --> 00:04:22.206
<i>Something's coming.</i>

00:04:24.821 --> 00:04:28.133
- AHTI: ### for a visit.

00:04:28.878 --> 00:04:30.950
I helped you...

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.996
...you owe me now.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.893
And when time comes...

00:04:35.973 --> 00:04:38.246
...I will come ###.

00:04:47.192 --> 00:04:48.712
- EMILY: Hi, Jesse.

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:55.521
- JESSE: I keep finding traces of Darling,
but still can't find him.

00:04:55.668 --> 00:04:57.108
Where could he be?

00:04:57.501 --> 00:05:00.662
- EMILY: He's usually in his office
in Research or one of his labs.

00:05:00.596 --> 00:05:03.455
Dr. Darling has quite a few
all around the bureau.

00:05:03.482 --> 00:05:05.549
Could be hiding in any one of them.

00:05:05.284 --> 00:05:09.976
I checked myself but
I don't have access to most of them.

00:05:10.234 --> 00:05:12.559
- JESSE: <i>Sounds like a ###</i>

00:05:12.942 --> 00:05:15.001
He didn't let you in his labs?

00:05:15.592 --> 00:05:17.064
- EMILY: Not all of them, no.

00:05:16.918 --> 00:05:19.122
Some has volatile material.

00:05:19.176 --> 00:05:22.622
(SCOFFS) Ridiculous! I mean
the whole place is volatile material.

00:05:22.655 --> 00:05:24.996
Could've at least thought of
a more convincing lie.

00:05:24.905 --> 00:05:28.265
How can I work without access
to all the data possible?

00:05:32.135 --> 00:05:34.858
- JESSE: This place has a bad habit
of moving around, huh?

00:05:34.945 --> 00:05:37.082
- EMILY: So you noticed the building shifts.

00:05:37.117 --> 00:05:42.207
Did you know that 39% of bureau accidents
are caused by the shifts?

00:05:42.347 --> 00:05:43.393
It's true!

00:05:43.478 --> 00:05:45.330
I ran numbers with myself.

00:05:45.477 --> 00:05:47.477
- JESSE: So they're dangerous?

00:05:47.638 --> 00:05:49.229
- EMILY: Uh oh. <i>Very!</i>

00:05:49.269 --> 00:05:55.402
One time, a shark got shifted into a meeting room
along with over 2000 gallons of water.

00:05:55.549 --> 00:05:57.229
It was a tiger shark.

00:05:57.265 --> 00:06:00.044
Darling's pet research project.

00:06:00.283 --> 00:06:02.876
Never get what he was researching.

00:06:04.182 --> 00:06:06.449
- JESSE: <i>How did people work here?</i>

00:06:09.965 --> 00:06:11.971
You said you're an assistant?

00:06:12.401 --> 00:06:16.484
Oh, it's just a title. I'm a scientist.
A researcher. I work for Dr. Darling.

00:06:16.588 --> 00:06:19.584
When bureau agents go out in the field
that signs of Altered World Events...

00:06:19.505 --> 00:06:23.281
We study the materials,
the Altered Items, they bring back.

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:25.758
It's always something
that we've never seen before.

00:06:25.787 --> 00:06:31.336
Studying them requires new instruments,
methodologies, or sometimes new field of science.

00:06:31.684 --> 00:06:33.684
- JESSE: <i>### really love your job.</i>

00:06:33.756 --> 00:06:35.949
- EMILY: See, there's no guide book
for what we do here.

00:06:35.976 --> 00:06:40.904
Everything that happens at the bureau,
including the science, is without president.

00:06:43.902 --> 00:06:47.088
- JESSE: What exactly is the Oceanview Motel?

00:06:47.687 --> 00:06:50.709
- EMILY: That's a bigger question
than you might think.

00:06:50.736 --> 00:06:54.896
You see, I have extreme doubts
that the motel a single place.

00:06:54.976 --> 00:06:58.233
Look at all the doors inside it.
Where did they all go?

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.157
We know that one door
leads to the Oldest House but...

00:07:01.037 --> 00:07:04.077
...how can we can only
ever open that one door?

00:07:04.152 --> 00:07:07.358
Maybe to open a door, you have to
have entered through it.

00:07:07.399 --> 00:07:12.591
So if every door leads to different... dimension...
plane... reality, whatever you wanna call it, then...

00:07:12.685 --> 00:07:17.706
...I believe that the motel is a firm proof
that parallel universes exist.

00:07:18.077 --> 00:07:20.422
- JESSE: Does Darling agree with that?

00:07:20.516 --> 00:07:24.357
- EMILY: I haven't told him yet.
I'm waiting until I can prove it.

00:07:27.394 --> 00:07:30.442
- JESSE: What can you tell me
about Control Points?

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:34.200
- EMILY: They're nexus points
of the Oldest House's unique energies.

00:07:34.071 --> 00:07:39.537
Well, I wrote a 30-page proposal hypothesising
that we could siphon energy directly from them.

00:07:39.647 --> 00:07:43.182
Darling didn't even get through
the first page before turning it down.

00:07:43.236 --> 00:07:44.562
- JESSE: Right.

00:07:45.715 --> 00:07:50.214
And um... has anyone ever used them
to teleport around?

00:07:50.327 --> 00:07:52.061
- EMILY: What... uh... no.

00:07:51.944 --> 00:07:53.897
You mean physically?

00:07:54.101 --> 00:07:56.368
Then no, not that I've ever heard of.

00:07:56.441 --> 00:07:57.580
Why?

00:07:57.947 --> 00:08:00.992
- JESSE: Because that's how they work for me.

00:08:01.264 --> 00:08:03.083
- EMILY: What? Really?

00:08:03.263 --> 00:08:04.569
Oh my god!

00:08:04.609 --> 00:08:06.440
More tests!

00:08:07.262 --> 00:08:11.310
- JESSE: Let's hold off from the tests
until later, okay?

00:08:13.007 --> 00:08:15.637
- EMILY: Okay... I just... wow!

00:08:16.011 --> 00:08:18.921
This blows my Control Point theory
right out of the water!

00:08:18.962 --> 00:08:20.326
I love it!

00:08:23.103 --> 00:08:24.783
- JESSE: See you soon.

00:08:24.596 --> 00:08:26.596
- EMILY: Be careful out there.
