- JESSE: Even if it was a dream...

00:00:37.895 --> 00:00:41.632
...I feel Darling reached out to me
through the Hotline.

00:00:42.938 --> 00:00:47.764
I have a feeling he and Trench won't be
the only colours from beyond.

00:00:51.005 --> 00:01:07.269
(UNINTELLIGIBLE, MUFFLED SPEECH)

00:01:08.131 --> 00:01:10.253
Problem in the Foundation?

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.338
That was Ahti's vacation spot.

00:01:13.972 --> 00:01:15.705
We need to check this out.

00:02:03.847 --> 00:02:04.847
Dark...

00:02:05.393 --> 00:02:06.678
Quiet...

00:02:07.256 --> 00:02:09.075
Transdimentional.

00:02:10.175 --> 00:02:12.890
This place really suits Ahti.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.403
So that etching is the door.

00:02:33.531 --> 00:02:34.650
Okay.

00:02:34.837 --> 00:02:36.517
Let's try opening it.

00:02:50.286 --> 00:02:51.966
No time for sightseeing.

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.266
The Board said this was an emergency.

00:03:02.532 --> 00:03:03.812
(MACHINE STARTS)

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:08.503
Looks like no one's been down here in a while.

00:03:26.208 --> 00:03:27.208
Hm...

00:03:27.986 --> 00:03:29.960
Crystals are kinda pretty.

00:03:30.694 --> 00:03:33.848
Emily would be having a few days down here.

00:03:37.557 --> 00:03:39.682
What's that light?

00:03:56.002 --> 00:03:57.802
- MARSHALL: <i>The Foundation.</i>

00:03:58.723 --> 00:04:00.836
<i>Bottom of the Oldest House.</i>

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.300
<i>Stop the Hiss.</i>

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.580
- JESSE: Marshall?

00:04:04.306 --> 00:04:06.461
How is she on the Hotline?

00:04:06.532 --> 00:04:07.532
Unless...

00:04:08.188 --> 00:04:09.662
...she's dead.

00:04:10.356 --> 00:04:14.996
Jesus, she seems like the kind of woman
who could survive anything.

00:04:27.001 --> 00:04:29.014
###

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:59.687
Those structures...

00:05:59.754 --> 00:06:03.078
Is that... the Astral Plane?

00:06:03.165 --> 00:06:05.650
How is that possible?

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:10.354
This is worse than I thought.
I need to figure out what's going on.

00:06:55.864 --> 00:06:58.856
### using pickaxes now?

00:07:57.675 --> 00:08:00.803
The Astral Plan is cutting into our dimension.

00:08:01.005 --> 00:08:03.526
What if this is happening on the upper floors?

00:08:03.551 --> 00:08:05.443
It'll destroy the bureau.

00:08:21.908 --> 00:08:24.235
I wish I brought Emily with me.

00:08:24.303 --> 00:08:27.406
### my Head of Research right about now.

00:08:28.603 --> 00:08:29.603
Marshall?

00:08:30.393 --> 00:08:33.226
Marshall! You're alive!

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.127
Wait! It's Jesse!

00:08:36.047 --> 00:08:37.626
The director!

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.240
Woah!

00:08:46.616 --> 00:08:48.928
This place is huge!

00:08:49.766 --> 00:08:51.038
Marshall?

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:53.062
Can you hear me?

00:08:53.562 --> 00:08:58.368
She was on the Hotline so that person
couldn't have been Marshall, right?

00:08:58.601 --> 00:09:00.194
One problem at a time.

00:09:00.221 --> 00:09:03.105
Let's see what's going on
with that pillar first.

00:09:12.048 --> 00:09:17.270
(UNINTELLIGIBLE, MUFFLED SPEECH)

00:09:23.762 --> 00:09:40.238
(UNINTELLIGIBLE, MUFFLED SPEECH)

00:09:51.074 --> 00:09:53.653
So I can only choose one?

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.703
I thought I was done with these tests.

00:12:13.997 --> 00:12:16.270
Okay, let's review...

00:12:16.815 --> 00:12:19.842
This broken pillar is called...

00:12:19.895 --> 00:12:20.895
...<i>The Nail.</i>

00:12:20.789 --> 00:12:22.668
It was broken by...

00:12:22.722 --> 00:12:29.921
...something and now the Astral Plane is bleeding
into the Foundation which will destroy the Oldest House...

00:12:29.954 --> 00:12:34.117
...the bureau and everyone inside.

00:12:34.357 --> 00:12:40.847
I need to find four locks, or keys, or whatever,
to stop that from happening.

00:12:40.892 --> 00:12:44.022
But I'm the director. I've handled worse.

00:12:44.442 --> 00:12:46.637
This should be simple.

00:12:47.068 --> 00:12:48.068
-ish.

00:12:54.072 --> 00:12:55.752
- MARSHALL: <i>The damn gun.</i>

00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:58.549
<i>Faden.</i>

00:12:59.635 --> 00:13:01.643
<i>Not sure she's ready.</i>

00:13:01.857 --> 00:13:03.724
- JESSE: I'm here, aren't I?

00:13:04.338 --> 00:13:07.238
I saved the bureau once,
and I'll do it again.

00:13:20.964 --> 00:13:21.964
Woah!

00:13:22.197 --> 00:13:24.169
I'm in the Astral Plane?

00:13:24.196 --> 00:13:27.440
This bleed is just getting worse and worse.

00:13:50.823 --> 00:13:52.772
That's the cave's sand.

00:13:52.813 --> 00:13:55.680
Looks like the Astral Bleed goes both ways.

00:14:18.618 --> 00:14:21.395
Hiss in the Astral Plane? (SCOFFS)

###

00:24:25.749 --> 00:24:27.270
Another etching.

00:24:27.417 --> 00:24:29.750
Like the one I used to get in here.

00:24:38.103 --> 00:24:42.320
(UNINTELLIGIBLE, MUFFLED SPEECH)

00:24:44.186 --> 00:24:48.826
Is this the lock/key the Board told me about?

00:24:55.745 --> 00:25:03.128
(UNINTELLIGIBLE, MUFFLED SPEECH)

00:25:03.329 --> 00:25:05.045
Just doing my job.

00:25:08.115 --> 00:25:09.563
First one down.

00:25:09.617 --> 00:25:12.362
Director Faden's got this covered.

00:25:32.892 --> 00:25:34.492
- EMILY: Jesse! Hey!

00:25:34.711 --> 00:25:37.511
- JESSE: <i>Emily? How did she get down here?</i>

00:25:38.355 --> 00:25:40.755
What are you doing down here, Emily?

00:25:41.267 --> 00:25:44.217
- EMILY: What do you mean?
You called me down, remember?

00:25:44.271 --> 00:25:46.688
- JESSE: I'm pretty sure I didn't.

00:25:47.402 --> 00:25:50.267
- EMILY: No, that's right. You didn't.
But then...

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:54.526
I remember you needed to come here.
I mean, you even told me how to get in.

00:25:54.635 --> 00:25:57.421
Let's just chalk it up to synchronousity
so we can get to work.

00:25:57.355 --> 00:25:59.955 line:0%
- JESSE: <i>She ### everything in ###.</i>

00:26:00.296 --> 00:26:02.930
The Board called me down here
to deal with the situation.

00:26:02.984 --> 00:26:04.664
The Astral Plane is...

00:26:04.297 --> 00:26:07.420 position:0% size:50%
- EMILY: ...coliding with our world, I know.
Isn't it fascinating?

00:26:07.447 --> 00:26:13.704
I never even consider that the Astral Plane could be a
physical volume extending beyond this dimensional container.

00:26:14.165 --> 00:26:18.713
The bleed is localised to this area.
But its growthrate seems steady.

00:26:19.306 --> 00:26:23.180
Given time, it will consume the entire bureau.

00:26:23.291 --> 00:26:24.891
And possibly beyond.

00:26:25.019 --> 00:26:26.792
- JESSE: That's what I'm here to stop.

00:26:26.815 --> 00:26:32.134
The Board told me to fix the Nail over there
by dismantling four locks in the Astral Plane.

00:26:32.734 --> 00:26:36.161
Funny, I think it's put itself back together a bit.

00:26:36.272 --> 00:26:38.969
- EMILY: So that could be due to
the Law Inverse Exchange.

00:26:38.996 --> 00:26:44.013
For every associated component you remove,
this Nail reconstructs.

00:26:44.074 --> 00:26:46.874
We're possibly some variation of anti-sympathy.

00:26:47.538 --> 00:26:49.604
Don't worry, I'll look into it.

00:26:50.269 --> 00:26:53.136
Did you notice all the bureau infrastructure?

00:26:53.202 --> 00:26:56.850
It looks like there was a research team station
down here at some point.

00:26:57.363 --> 00:26:59.476
You think Darling knew about this?

00:26:59.543 --> 00:27:01.561
- JESSE: I'd put money on that.

00:27:02.006 --> 00:27:03.446
That reminds me...

00:27:03.563 --> 00:27:05.395
Have you seen Marshall?

00:27:05.724 --> 00:27:08.523
She contacted me over the Hotline but...

00:27:08.643 --> 00:27:10.942
...then I saw her walking around.

00:27:11.761 --> 00:27:13.628
- EMILY: I haven't seen her.

00:27:13.795 --> 00:27:16.970
The Hotline only connects to ### entities...

00:27:17.051 --> 00:27:18.731
...or... dead people.

00:27:18.815 --> 00:27:22.719
But Marshall's proven time to time again
that she is a survivor.

00:27:23.063 --> 00:27:25.663
- JESSE: That's exactly what I thought.

00:27:26.546 --> 00:27:29.969
- EMILY: Anyway, I've been looking into
the minerals growing down here.

00:27:30.042 --> 00:27:33.408
Have you noticed how they insist
on maintaining a certain form?

00:27:33.472 --> 00:27:38.285
Maybe some sort of a state memory,
or they consciously prefer certain shape or...

00:27:38.019 --> 00:27:40.271 position:100% size:50%
- JESSE: I think we're on a clock here, Emily.

00:27:40.325 --> 00:27:44.286
I need to stop the Astral Bleeding
before it brings the Oldest House down.

00:27:44.428 --> 00:27:47.948
See what you can find out
from the Nail in the meantime.

00:27:48.266 --> 00:27:51.605
And send out some rangers
to look for Marshall.

00:27:52.521 --> 00:27:54.319
She may be in trouble.

00:27:54.747 --> 00:27:56.316
- EMILY: Will do, Jesse.

00:27:56.397 --> 00:28:00.493
If you see anything interesting,
remember to take detail notes.

00:28:05.121 --> 00:28:08.966
The rangers have tapped into an old radio network
they found around the Foundation.

00:28:09.007 --> 00:28:12.710
So if you need backup just call them
in one of the stations.

00:28:13.999 --> 00:28:16.671
- JESSE: How did the Hiss
get into the Foundation?

00:28:16.762 --> 00:28:18.677
- EMILY: Same way we did, I imagine.

00:28:18.584 --> 00:28:22.657
You need to remember that the Hiss
are the embodiment of persistence.
