- JESSE: Even if it was a dream...

00:00:37.895 --> 00:00:41.632
...I feel Darling reached out to me
through the Hotline.

00:00:42.938 --> 00:00:47.764
I have a feeling he and Trench won't be
the only colours from beyond.

(UNINTELLIGIBLE, MUFFLED SPEECH)

00:01:08.131 --> 00:01:10.253
Problem in the Foundation?

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.338
That was Ahti's vacation spot.

00:01:13.972 --> 00:01:15.705
We need to check this out.

00:02:03.847 --> 00:02:04.847
Dark...

00:02:05.393 --> 00:02:06.678
Quiet...

00:02:07.256 --> 00:02:09.075
Transdimentional.

00:02:10.175 --> 00:02:12.890
This place really suits Ahti.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.403
So that etching is the door.

00:02:33.531 --> 00:02:34.650
Okay.

00:02:34.837 --> 00:02:36.517
Let's try opening it.

00:02:50.286 --> 00:02:51.966
No time for sightseeing.

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.266
The Board said this was an emergency.

(MACHINE STARTS)

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:08.503
Looks like no one's been down here in a while.

00:03:26.208 --> 00:03:27.208
Hm...

00:03:27.986 --> 00:03:29.960
Crystals are kinda pretty.

00:03:30.694 --> 00:03:33.848
Emily would be having a few days down here.

00:03:37.557 --> 00:03:39.682

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.580
- JESSE: Marshall?

00:04:04.306 --> 00:04:06.461
How is she on the Hotline?

00:04:06.532 --> 00:04:07.532
Unless...

00:04:08.188 --> 00:04:09.662
...she's dead.

00:04:10.356 --> 00:04:14.996
Jesus, she seems like the kind of woman
who could survive anything.

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:59.687
Those structures...

00:05:59.754 --> 00:06:03.078
Is that... the Astral Plane?

00:06:03.165 --> 00:06:05.650
How is that possible?

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:10.354
This is worse than I thought.
I need to figure out what's going on.

00:06:55.864 --> 00:06:58.856
### using pickaxes now?

00:07:57.675 --> 00:08:00.803
The Astral Plan is cutting into our dimension.

00:08:01.005 --> 00:08:03.526
What if this is happening on the upper floors?

00:08:03.551 --> 00:08:05.443
It'll destroy the bureau.

00:08:21.908 --> 00:08:24.235
I wish I brought Emily with me.

00:08:24.303 --> 00:08:27.406
### my Head of Research right about now.

00:08:28.603 --> 00:08:29.603
Marshall?

00:08:30.393 --> 00:08:33.226
Marshall! You're alive!

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.127
Wait! It's Jesse!

00:08:36.047 --> 00:08:37.626
The director!

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.240
Woah!

00:08:46.616 --> 00:08:48.928
This place is huge!

00:08:49.766 --> 00:08:51.038
Marshall?

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:53.062
Can you hear me?

00:08:53.562 --> 00:08:58.368
She was on the Hotline so that person
couldn't have been Marshall, right?

00:08:58.601 --> 00:09:00.194
One problem at a time.

00:09:00.221 --> 00:09:03.105
Let's see what's going on
with that pillar first.

00:09:12.048 --> 00:09:17.270
(UNINTELLIGIBLE, MUFFLED SPEECH)

00:09:23.762 --> 00:09:40.238
(UNINTELLIGIBLE, MUFFLED SPEECH)

00:09:51.074 --> 00:09:53.653
So I can only choose one?

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.703
I thought I was done with these tests.

00:12:13.997 --> 00:12:16.270
Okay, let's review...

00:12:16.815 --> 00:12:19.842
This broken pillar is called...

00:12:19.895 --> 00:12:20.895
...<i>The Nail.</i>

00:12:20.789 --> 00:12:22.668
It was broken by...

00:12:22.722 --> 00:12:29.921
...something and now the Astral Plane is bleeding
into the Foundation which will destroy the Oldest House...

00:12:29.954 --> 00:12:34.117
...the bureau and everyone inside.

00:12:34.357 --> 00:12:40.847
I need to find four locks, or keys, or whatever,
to stop that from happening.

00:12:40.892 --> 00:12:44.022
But I'm the director. I've handled worse.

00:12:44.442 --> 00:12:46.637
This should be simple.

00:12:47.068 --> 00:12:48.068
-ish.

00:12:54.072 --> 00:12:55.752
- MARSHALL: <i>The damn gun.</i>

00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:58.549
<i>Faden.</i>

00:12:59.635 --> 00:13:01.643
<i>Not sure she's ready.</i>

00:13:01.857 --> 00:13:03.724
- JESSE: I'm here, aren't I?

00:13:04.338 --> 00:13:07.238
I saved the bureau once,
and I'll do it again.

00:13:20.964 --> 00:13:21.964
Woah!

00:13:22.197 --> 00:13:24.169
I'm in the Astral Plane?

00:13:24.196 --> 00:13:27.440
This bleed is just getting worse and worse.

00:13:50.823 --> 00:13:52.772
That's the cave's sand.

00:13:52.813 --> 00:13:55.680
Looks like the Astral Bleed goes both ways.

00:14:18.618 --> 00:14:21.395

Another etching.

00:24:27.417 --> 00:24:29.750
Like the one I used to get in here.

(UNINTELLIGIBLE, MUFFLED SPEECH)

00:24:44.186 --> 00:24:48.826
Is this the lock/key the Board told me about?

00:24:55.745 --> 00:25:03.128
(UNINTELLIGIBLE, MUFFLED SPEECH)

00:25:03.329 --> 00:25:05.045
Just doing my job.

00:25:08.115 --> 00:25:09.563
First one down.

00:25:09.617 --> 00:25:12.362
Director Faden's got this covered.

00:25:32.892 --> 00:25:34.492
- EMILY: Jesse! Hey!

00:25:34.711 --> 00:25:37.511
- JESSE: <i>Emily? How did she get down here?</i>

00:25:38.355 --> 00:25:40.755
What are you doing down here, Emily?

00:25:41.267 --> 00:25:44.217
- EMILY: What do you mean?
You called me down, remember?

00:25:44.271 --> 00:25:46.688
- JESSE: I'm pretty sure I didn't.

00:25:47.402 --> 00:25:50.267
- EMILY: No, that's right. You didn't.
But then...

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:54.526
I remember you needed to come here.
I mean, you even told me how to get in.

00:25:54.635 --> 00:25:57.421
Let's just chalk it up to synchronousity
so we can get to work.

00:25:57.355 --> 00:25:59.955 line:0%
- JESSE: <i>She ### everything in ###.</i>

00:26:00.296 --> 00:26:02.930
The Board called me down here
to deal with the situation.

00:26:02.984 --> 00:26:04.664
The Astral Plane is...

00:26:04.297 --> 00:26:07.420 position:0% size:50%
- EMILY: ...coliding with our world, I know.
Isn't it fascinating?

00:26:07.447 --> 00:26:13.704
I never even consider that the Astral Plane could be a
physical volume extending beyond this dimensional container.

00:26:14.165 --> 00:26:18.713
The bleed is localised to this area.
But its growthrate seems steady.

00:26:19.306 --> 00:26:23.180
Given time, it will consume the entire bureau.

00:26:23.291 --> 00:26:24.891
And possibly beyond.

00:26:25.019 --> 00:26:26.792
- JESSE: That's what I'm here to stop.

00:26:26.815 --> 00:26:32.134
The Board told me to fix the Nail over there
by dismantling four locks in the Astral Plane.

00:26:32.734 --> 00:26:36.161
Funny, I think it's put itself back together a bit.

00:26:36.272 --> 00:26:38.969
- EMILY: So that could be due to
the Law Inverse Exchange.

00:26:38.996 --> 00:26:44.013
For every associated component you remove,
this Nail reconstructs.

00:26:44.074 --> 00:26:46.874
We're possibly some variation of anti-sympathy.

00:26:47.538 --> 00:26:49.604
Don't worry, I'll look into it.

00:26:50.269 --> 00:26:53.136
Did you notice all the bureau infrastructure?

00:26:53.202 --> 00:26:56.850
It looks like there was a research team station
down here at some point.

00:26:57.363 --> 00:26:59.476
You think Darling knew about this?

00:26:59.543 --> 00:27:01.561
- JESSE: I'd put money on that.

00:27:02.006 --> 00:27:03.446
That reminds me...

00:27:03.563 --> 00:27:05.395
Have you seen Marshall?

00:27:05.724 --> 00:27:08.523
She contacted me over the Hotline but...

00:27:08.643 --> 00:27:10.942
...then I saw her walking around.

00:27:11.761 --> 00:27:13.628
- EMILY: I haven't seen her.

00:27:13.795 --> 00:27:16.970
The Hotline only connects to ### entities...

00:27:17.051 --> 00:27:18.731
...or... dead people.

00:27:18.815 --> 00:27:22.719
But Marshall's proven time to time again
that she is a survivor.

00:27:23.063 --> 00:27:25.663
- JESSE: That's exactly what I thought.

00:27:26.546 --> 00:27:29.969
- EMILY: Anyway, I've been looking into
the minerals growing down here.

00:27:30.042 --> 00:27:33.408
Have you noticed how they insist
on maintaining a certain form?

00:27:33.472 --> 00:27:38.285
Maybe some sort of a state memory,
or they consciously prefer certain shape or...

00:27:38.019 --> 00:27:40.271 position:100% size:50%
- JESSE: I think we're on a clock here, Emily.

00:27:40.325 --> 00:27:44.286
I need to stop the Astral Bleeding
before it brings the Oldest House down.

00:27:44.428 --> 00:27:47.948
See what you can find out
from the Nail in the meantime.

00:27:48.266 --> 00:27:51.605
And send out some rangers
to look for Marshall.

00:27:52.521 --> 00:27:54.319
She may be in trouble.

00:27:54.747 --> 00:27:56.316
- EMILY: Will do, Jesse.

00:27:56.397 --> 00:28:00.493
If you see anything interesting,
remember to take detail notes.

00:28:05.121 --> 00:28:08.966
The rangers have tapped into an old radio network
they found around the Foundation.

00:28:09.007 --> 00:28:12.710
So if you need backup just call them
in one of the stations.

00:28:13.999 --> 00:28:16.671
- JESSE: How did the Hiss
get into the Foundation?

00:28:16.762 --> 00:28:18.677
- EMILY: Same way we did, I imagine.

00:28:18.584 --> 00:28:22.657
You need to remember that the Hiss
are the embodiment of persistence.

00:28:22.684 --> 00:28:28.044
Their nature seems to be one of ###
to find every possible vunerability and exploit it.

00:28:28.084 --> 00:28:30.368
Their only goal is consumption.

00:28:30.595 --> 00:28:33.666
- JESSE: I'm sure there're plenty
of goodies for them down here.

00:28:33.706 --> 00:28:35.543
The Nail, for instance.

00:28:36.149 --> 00:28:39.489
- EMILY: If the Hiss could corrupt the Nail
I'm sure they would've by now.

00:28:39.516 --> 00:28:42.382
It must uninterest them
in its broken state.

00:28:42.494 --> 00:28:47.344
It could be destroyed by numerous unknown
paranatural materials I'm sure lying around.

00:28:47.424 --> 00:28:49.814
These are the roots of the Oldest House.

00:28:49.837 --> 00:28:52.600
The Hiss will find plenty of ways to make trouble.

00:28:52.641 --> 00:28:55.107
- JESSE: They're pretty good at that.

00:28:56.619 --> 00:28:59.258
So you've never heard of the Foundation, huh?

00:28:59.325 --> 00:29:02.033
- EMILY: I haven't even seen the name reference.

00:29:01.727 --> 00:29:04.527
It's clearly it's highly classified but...

00:29:04.619 --> 00:29:06.431
...for what reason?

00:29:06.836 --> 00:29:12.519
The problem with these kinds of close-off
hidden areas is that they will likely sealed for good reason.

00:29:12.539 --> 00:29:15.811
But now no one is left to tell us
what that reason was.

00:29:16.066 --> 00:29:19.203
- JESSE: Any guesses why the bureau
would hide something like this?

00:29:19.234 --> 00:29:20.945
- EMILY: I only know what I've observed.

00:29:20.692 --> 00:29:25.278
This place is spacely rigid, which means
it doesn't shift like the rest of the Oldest House.

00:29:25.337 --> 00:29:28.543
###

00:29:28.657 --> 00:29:32.582

00:29:32.649 --> 00:29:34.908

00:29:35.016 --> 00:29:37.153
###

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:41.021
- JESSE: The Astral Plane ###.

00:29:41.388 --> 00:29:43.020
###

00:29:45.316 --> 00:29:47.182
So let me get this straight.

00:29:46.988 --> 00:29:50.124
The Astral Plane is bleeding into the Foundation.

00:29:50.419 --> 00:29:51.779
- EMILY: Correct!

00:29:51.883 --> 00:29:55.345
- JESSE: And that's happening
because the Nail is damaged.

00:29:55.452 --> 00:29:59.359
- EMILY: I'd say it's a bit more than damaged
but yes, that is my understanding.

00:29:59.396 --> 00:30:03.615
- JESSE: So what's the connection between
the Nail and the Astral Plane?

00:30:03.942 --> 00:30:05.428
- EMILY: It's a good question!

00:30:05.194 --> 00:30:09.317
I was picture Object of Power ###
our plane and the Astral.

00:30:09.336 --> 00:30:13.731
If the Nail has the similar relationship then
maybe it's more accurate to think of it like plumming.

00:30:13.838 --> 00:30:17.583
Now that the Nail is busted,
sewage is gusing everywhere.

00:30:18.159 --> 00:30:20.559 line:0%
- JESSE: <i>Not the prettiest metaphor.</i>

00:30:22.387 --> 00:30:24.253
I should get back out there.

00:30:24.015 --> 00:30:27.279
- EMILY: Agree. The Astral Bleed won't stop itself.

00:32:06.345 --> 00:32:08.811
- MARSHALL: <i>The worst I've ever seen.</i>

00:32:09.651 --> 00:32:11.437
<i>Hiss take the Nail.</i>

00:32:12.597 --> 00:32:13.957
<i>End of the world.</i>

00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:16.443
- JESSE: <i>So I can't let the Hiss take the Nail.</i>

00:32:16.497 --> 00:32:19.163
<i>Not a problem!
I know how to handle them.</i>

00:34:21.910 --> 00:34:24.710
I need a ranger sent to this location ###.

00:36:45.014 --> 00:36:46.214
- JESSE: Hello?

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:48.600

Wait! I'm back here?

00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:24.200

Blame the eyeball.

00:37:31.684 --> 00:37:32.684
Former?

00:37:32.724 --> 00:37:34.404
You mean the eyeball?

00:37:34.444 --> 00:37:36.510
I don't even know what that is.

00:37:36.641 --> 00:37:39.433
But it is giving me something you won't.

00:38:20.734 --> 00:38:23.866
I don't like you deciding
what I can/can't have.

00:39:26.024 --> 00:39:29.643
I'm getting pretty tired of being
jerked around the Astral Plane.

00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:32.895
If you're listening, I want some answers!

00:40:05.524 --> 00:40:06.524
Uh...

00:40:06.677 --> 00:40:07.677
Hi there!

00:40:07.883 --> 00:40:11.595
It was nice of you to give me
something the Board wouldn't.

00:40:12.355 --> 00:40:14.422
What are you getting out of it?

00:40:18.273 --> 00:40:21.665
So I'm just supposed to believe your
particularly charitable...

00:40:21.932 --> 00:40:22.932
...uh...

00:40:23.818 --> 00:40:25.418
...whatever you are?

00:40:30.012 --> 00:40:31.012
Hungry?

00:40:31.571 --> 00:40:32.571
I mean...

00:40:32.611 --> 00:40:35.211
Yeah! Actually, I'd love
a sandwich or something.

00:40:35.892 --> 00:40:38.159
That's not what you meant, was it?

00:40:43.919 --> 00:40:45.653
Are you part of the Board?

00:40:45.705 --> 00:40:47.044
Or used to be?

00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:52.500
Okay.

00:40:52.545 --> 00:40:57.037
So you split because the Board blamed you for...

00:41:03.835 --> 00:41:05.880
###

00:41:06.767 --> 00:41:08.634
Do I need to rescue someone?

00:41:14.328 --> 00:41:16.261
I don't know what I expected.

00:41:16.918 --> 00:41:17.918
Listen.

00:41:18.284 --> 00:41:21.634
This's been great, but...
I have to go.

00:41:22.576 --> 00:41:25.555
Thanks for your help,
and... uh...

00:41:26.138 --> 00:41:27.985
Stay out of trouble.

00:41:36.183 --> 00:41:39.575
<i>What was the Former trying
to tell me about the Board?</i>

00:41:39.736 --> 00:41:41.736
<i>Should I trust either of them?</i>

00:42:30.638 --> 00:42:32.838
- RANGER: You got this, director!

00:46:56.576 --> 00:46:58.909
- JESSE: <i>Who should I be listening to?</i>

00:46:58.936 --> 00:47:01.608
<i>Weird entity A or B?</i>

00:47:01.742 --> 00:47:04.795
<i>Or neither. Let's just ### for now.</i>

00:47:04.817 --> 00:47:06.497
<i>The bureau is in danger.</i>

00:47:06.730 --> 00:47:09.063
<i>We know we need to repair the Nail.</i>

00:47:09.103 --> 00:47:13.268
<i>The Astral Plane won't break reality on my watch.</i>

00:49:29.652 --> 00:49:31.252
<i>There's the etching.</i>

00:51:40.686 --> 00:51:43.105
<i>###</i>

00:51:49.793 --> 00:51:50.793
<i>I'm...</i>

00:51:50.859 --> 00:51:54.127
<i>...overthinking this whole Board - Former thing.</i>

00:51:54.221 --> 00:51:58.765
<i>They can sort out their own business
so as long as it doesn't get in my way.</i>

00:51:58.871 --> 00:52:02.583
<i>Obsessing over these problems
is something Trench would do.</i>

00:52:02.678 --> 00:52:05.069
<i>But I've got my intuition.</i>

00:52:05.256 --> 00:52:06.256
<i>And you.</i>

00:52:46.319 --> 00:52:48.786
- EMILY: The Nail is almost repaired.

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:52.008
You really do have an act
for this kind of work!

00:52:53.673 --> 00:52:56.073
- JESSE: Any progress with the Nail?

00:52:55.936 --> 00:52:57.222
- EMILY: Of course.

00:52:57.146 --> 00:52:59.459 position:0% size:50%
I've been busy with surface analysis.

00:52:58.779 --> 00:53:03.645 position:100% size:50%
Its composition is remarkably similar
to ### materials found in the Astral Plane.

00:53:02.939 --> 00:53:06.177 position:0% size:50%
But it altered itself
between my observations.

00:53:06.231 --> 00:53:09.008
### like it doesn't like being examined.

00:53:09.428 --> 00:53:12.328
- JESSE: So the Nail is from
the Astral Plane?

00:53:12.443 --> 00:53:14.513
- EMILY: Not necessarily.

00:53:14.547 --> 00:53:18.348
If we assume that, we're suddenly
facing a lot of new questions.

00:53:18.490 --> 00:53:21.450
How did something so large
get out of the Astral Plane?

00:53:21.117 --> 00:53:23.717
How did it get inside the Oldest House?

00:53:23.467 --> 00:53:26.067
Did a Threshold bring it in?
Did people?

00:53:25.868 --> 00:53:27.548
Maybe through the motel.

00:53:27.648 --> 00:53:29.914
- JESSE: Maybe it was always here.

00:53:29.965 --> 00:53:31.085
- EMILY: Mm...

00:53:31.138 --> 00:53:32.138
Doubtful.

00:53:34.003 --> 00:53:37.776
- JESSE: Have you spent any time
looking into the crystals growing around here?

00:53:37.843 --> 00:53:39.436
- EMILY: As if I could resist!

00:53:39.469 --> 00:53:41.669
The biggest question is where it comes from.

00:53:41.557 --> 00:53:44.463
A Threshold, or is it native to the Foundation?

00:53:44.250 --> 00:53:47.759
But if so, why doesn't it grows
in the rest of the Oldest House?

00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:54.496
The fact that they return to an earlier state when damaged
is severely inconsistent with our reality ### linear time.

00:53:54.602 --> 00:53:57.469
So either they're A: Partially conscious...

00:53:57.604 --> 00:54:03.313
...or B: Organic elements that are foreign to
and yet influenced by our dimension.

00:54:03.351 --> 00:54:05.031
The jury's still out.

00:54:05.706 --> 00:54:08.418
Have you learnt anything about the crystals?

00:54:08.492 --> 00:54:11.437
- JESSE: I have a power that let me stretch them.

00:54:11.531 --> 00:54:12.571
- EMILY: Huh!

00:54:13.135 --> 00:54:14.175
- JESSE: Yep!

00:54:16.819 --> 00:54:20.212
Any idea what Marshall
would be doing down here?

00:54:20.636 --> 00:54:24.412
- EMILY: That information
is on a need-to-know basis, Faden!

00:54:24.815 --> 00:54:26.970
Sorry! I couldn't resist!

00:54:27.012 --> 00:54:30.002 position:0% size:50%
But honestly, I've never have much
interaction with Marshall.

00:54:29.447 --> 00:54:32.479 position:100% size:50%
She only came to me
when she was looking for Darling.

00:54:32.555 --> 00:54:34.936 position:0% size:50%
But this is Helen Marshall
we're talking about.

00:54:34.483 --> 00:54:38.060
The woman who single-handedly
dealt with the ### AWE.

00:54:38.111 --> 00:54:41.050
### down here is because she needs to be.

00:54:41.484 --> 00:54:42.524 line:0%
- JESSE: <i>Wow.</i>

00:54:42.707 --> 00:54:45.779 line:0%
<i>Clearly she couldn't handle this one on her own.</i>

00:54:47.569 --> 00:54:49.303
I'll see you later, Emily.

00:54:49.627 --> 00:54:51.627
- EMILY: Good luck!
Take notes!

00:56:22.042 --> 00:56:24.842
- JESSE: <i>This area looks... newer.</i>

00:56:24.882 --> 00:56:27.096
<i>Is it from the upper floors?</i>

00:56:51.552 --> 00:56:54.285
<i>There's something behind
the Hiss barrier.</i>

00:58:06.092 --> 00:58:07.772
This is the director.

00:58:07.478 --> 00:58:10.378
I need a ranger at this location immediately.

00:58:09.924 --> 00:58:12.124
- RANGER: We're in this together!

00:59:24.233 --> 00:59:28.001
- JESSE: (LAUGHS) Someone calls a plummer!

00:59:28.162 --> 00:59:30.181
<i>But no one's around to hear that.</i>

01:00:46.645 --> 01:00:49.398
(ALARM SOUND)

01:00:53.864 --> 01:00:57.823
- ROBOT VOICE: Warning! Altered Item detected
in ###.

01:00:57.890 --> 01:01:01.767
###

01:01:14.091 --> 01:01:17.739
- JESSE: <i>So that's the Altered Item.
Looks pretty secured.</i>

01:01:19.717 --> 01:01:20.717
<i>No power.</i>

01:01:20.796 --> 01:01:21.796
<i>Typical.</i>

01:01:30.749 --> 01:01:33.885
<i>I should hire someone
who builds smaller machines.</i>

01:02:44.551 --> 01:02:49.544
- ROBOT VOICE: ###

01:03:01.107 --> 01:03:04.286
No Altered materials detected in the area.

01:03:04.353 --> 01:03:06.772
Personel may now safely enter.

01:03:07.106 --> 01:03:09.485
Have a "bureau-ful" day!

01:05:00.793 --> 01:05:02.473
- MARSHALL: <i>Hiss got in.</i>

01:05:03.682 --> 01:05:04.682
<i>Boom!</i>

01:05:06.282 --> 01:05:07.282
<i>The Nail.</i>

01:05:08.885 --> 01:05:10.893
<i>Pile of smoking rubble.</i>

01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:13.253
- JESSE: <i>Marshall blew up the Nail?</i>

01:05:13.098 --> 01:05:15.165
<i>What the hell was she thinking?</i>

01:05:27.608 --> 01:05:28.608
<i>Alright.</i>

01:05:28.691 --> 01:05:30.371
<i>This is the last one.</i>

01:05:36.214 --> 01:05:41.111
<i>I can't believe Marshall ### plan
was to blow up the Nail.</i>

01:05:42.842 --> 01:05:44.909
<i>And she thought I wasn't ready.</i>

01:06:29.078 --> 01:06:31.383
<i>There. Easy ###.</i>

01:06:31.433 --> 01:06:32.433
<i>Fuck!</i>

01:06:32.461 --> 01:06:34.141
<i>But that's the last one!</i>

01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:36.139
<i>I-I fixed it, didn't I?</i>

01:06:53.639 --> 01:06:54.639
<i>Holy shit!</i>

01:07:15.879 --> 01:07:16.999
<i>Oh, thank god!</i>

01:07:22.873 --> 01:07:25.240
<i>What the hell was all that?</i>

01:07:25.730 --> 01:07:28.385
<i>Things should be better now. Not worse!</i>

01:07:28.574 --> 01:07:29.854
<i>Emily will know.</i>

01:07:30.029 --> 01:07:31.029
<i>I hope.</i>

01:08:11.737 --> 01:08:13.870
- EMILY: Jesse! We need to talk!

01:08:17.226 --> 01:08:20.170
What did you do?
What is causing these tremors?

01:08:20.429 --> 01:08:22.896
- JESSE: I thought you could tell me!

01:08:23.022 --> 01:08:25.871
I completed the four rituals just like
the Board told me to.

01:08:25.905 --> 01:08:28.238
The Astral Bleed should've stopped.

01:08:28.578 --> 01:08:31.478
- EMILY: It has stopped.
The Nail is repaired.

01:08:31.568 --> 01:08:33.227
But we have a new problem.

01:08:33.306 --> 01:08:38.338
My analysis of the Nail indicates that it is
literally a piece of the Astral Plane.

01:08:38.449 --> 01:08:41.349
Or possibly ### containing the Astral Plane.

01:08:41.406 --> 01:08:42.406
Or both.

01:08:42.735 --> 01:08:43.775
Either way...

01:08:43.717 --> 01:08:48.069
Right now, both dimensions are vibrating
in completely incompatible frequencies.

01:08:48.276 --> 01:08:51.946
### incalculable!

01:08:52.223 --> 01:08:55.082
It's going to destroy both the planes.

01:08:55.869 --> 01:08:57.869
- JESSE: I messed this all up!

01:08:58.197 --> 01:09:01.097
Maybe Marshall was right to destroy the Nail.

01:09:01.674 --> 01:09:03.674
I should've left it in pieces.

01:09:04.653 --> 01:09:07.778
- EMILY: Then the Astral Plane
would still be leaking in.

01:09:07.801 --> 01:09:10.667
Sometimes, there's no right answers, Jesse.

01:09:10.728 --> 01:09:12.408
We need more information.

01:09:12.562 --> 01:09:13.562
- JESSE: No!

01:09:13.995 --> 01:09:16.211
I need to fix this, NOW!

01:09:16.723 --> 01:09:17.723
I'll just...

01:09:18.824 --> 01:09:20.558
I'll figure something out.

01:09:20.824 --> 01:09:23.301
- EMILY: No, we should really make a plan.

01:09:23.427 --> 01:09:27.464
The tremor is originating from directly
below us. But we don't know what--

01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:28.272 position:100% size:50%
- JESSE: Perfect!

01:09:28.295 --> 01:09:30.523 position:100% size:50%
I'll head down and take care of
whatever's going on.

01:09:30.546 --> 01:09:32.613 position:100% size:50%
Just do what you can from here.

01:09:32.629 --> 01:09:34.079 position:0% size:50%
- EMILY: Jesse, you can't just--

01:09:33.869 --> 01:09:35.602 position:100% size:50%
- JESSE: I have to, Emily!

01:09:36.452 --> 01:09:37.812 position:100% size:50%
I'm the director!

01:09:38.998 --> 01:09:41.002
This is on me.

01:09:59.949 --> 01:10:02.363
<i>I hope I know what I'm doing.</i>

01:10:03.837 --> 01:10:06.436
<i>That was just the top of the Nail?</i>

01:10:06.458 --> 01:10:09.329
<i>How much deeper does the Foundation go?</i>

01:10:21.134 --> 01:10:23.533
<i>The crystals are growing like crazy.</i>

01:10:24.133 --> 01:10:25.870
<i>###</i>

01:10:40.983 --> 01:10:42.783
- MARSHALL: <i>Astral Spiking.</i>

01:10:43.749 --> 01:10:45.704
<i>HRA was damaged.</i>

01:10:47.267 --> 01:10:48.387
<i>The Board ###.</i>

01:10:48.417 --> 01:10:50.499
- JESSE: <i>When Marshall blew up the Nail...</i>

01:10:50.510 --> 01:10:52.325
<i>...the Board attacked her.</i>

01:10:52.459 --> 01:10:54.139
<i>I don't fucking like it.</i>

01:11:42.633 --> 01:11:44.233
Director Faden here.

01:11:44.117 --> 01:11:46.827
I need a ranger dispatched at my position.

01:11:48.846 --> 01:11:51.113
- RANGER: Reinforcements are here!

01:12:02.839 --> 01:12:04.359
(MUSIC INTENSIFIES)

01:12:08.923 --> 01:12:10.363
- JESSE: Marshall?

01:12:10.626 --> 01:12:11.626
You're...

01:12:12.059 --> 01:12:13.059
...alive!

01:12:13.503 --> 01:12:16.498
- MARSHALL: Soon, you will no longer
recognise us...

01:12:16.513 --> 01:12:20.719
...or yourself, or him, or her, or them.

01:12:20.765 --> 01:12:22.291
Family is dead.

01:12:22.347 --> 01:12:24.220
The walls are broken but...

01:12:24.587 --> 01:12:26.572
(DISTORTED VOICE) ###.

01:12:26.284 --> 01:12:27.970 position:100% size:50%
- JESSE: Goddammit!

01:12:30.672 --> 01:12:32.672 position:100% size:50%
These fuckers take everything!

01:12:32.962 --> 01:12:35.068 position:100% size:50%
I'm not letting you take this!

01:14:11.415 --> 01:14:12.415
Out of ammo?

01:15:03.893 --> 01:15:06.493
Sorry I wasn't there to help, Marshall.

01:15:08.034 --> 01:15:09.714
<i>The Nail is corrupted.</i>

01:15:09.844 --> 01:15:14.618
<i>That explains why the Board wasn't answering
what's causing the quakes.</i>

01:15:14.645 --> 01:15:17.324
<i>Marshall came down here to stop this.</i>

01:15:17.458 --> 01:15:19.191
<i>I should've been with her.</i>

01:15:19.333 --> 01:15:21.013
<i>I could've saved her.</i>

01:15:21.074 --> 01:15:23.408
<i>But I can still save everyone else.</i>

01:15:56.665 --> 01:15:58.580
<i>Well, fuck you too!</i>

01:15:59.003 --> 01:16:00.020
Oh...

01:16:00.054 --> 01:16:01.414
I'll be sure too.

01:16:02.397 --> 01:16:03.997
<i>Let's play it smart.</i>

01:16:04.023 --> 01:16:05.946
<i>They don't need to know I'm onto them.</i>

01:16:06.058 --> 01:16:07.629
<i>Not yet, anyway.</i>

01:16:41.657 --> 01:16:43.345
The Nail is secured.

01:16:43.508 --> 01:16:45.113
The Hiss can't touch it.

01:16:45.142 --> 01:16:50.102
I can't undo the Astral Bleed in the Foundation
but at least it stopped.

01:16:50.220 --> 01:16:52.314
- EMILY: Along with ###.

01:16:52.559 --> 01:16:54.173
You did it, Jesse!

01:16:55.224 --> 01:16:57.161
Did you ever find Marshall?

01:16:57.229 --> 01:16:58.568
- JESSE: I did.

01:16:58.690 --> 01:16:59.927
She's gone.

01:17:00.612 --> 01:17:03.279
She died thinking she'd save the bureau.

01:17:04.108 --> 01:17:05.708
Not a bad way to go.

01:17:10.317 --> 01:17:12.384
I wasn't ready for this crisis.

01:17:13.090 --> 01:17:14.704
### coming.

01:17:17.362 --> 01:17:19.034
But I promise...

01:17:19.046 --> 01:17:21.507
...I'll be ready for the next one.

01:17:23.100 --> 01:17:24.299
I mean...

01:17:24.322 --> 01:17:27.701
...what good of a director who can't
hold her bureau together.

01:17:58.419 --> 01:18:01.204
I thought I know how to handle things.

01:18:01.249 --> 01:18:02.983
Now that I'm the director.

01:18:04.044 --> 01:18:07.125
Clearly, it's not that simple.

01:18:08.496 --> 01:18:11.363
I need to choose a director for the bureau.

01:18:11.506 --> 01:18:14.438
It should be one that serves our goals.

01:18:14.514 --> 01:18:15.851
Not the Board's.

01:18:16.118 --> 01:18:17.577
Or whatever those are.

01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:20.330
I need to lead my way.
