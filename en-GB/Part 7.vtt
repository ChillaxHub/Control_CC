- DARLING: <i>I've been fielding...</i>

00:01:52.357 --> 00:01:54.189
<i>...questions recently...</i>

00:01:54.993 --> 00:01:56.919
<i>...regarding HRAs:</i>

00:01:57.555 --> 00:01:59.372
<i>What are they for?</i>

00:01:59.492 --> 00:02:01.633
<i>Do you always need to wear them?</i>

00:02:02.604 --> 00:02:03.604
<i>And...</i>

00:02:04.597 --> 00:02:08.229
<i>...what's the deal with
the Hedron Resonance, anyway?</i>

00:02:10.283 --> 00:02:11.283
<i>I'll...</i>

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:11.889
(GLASS BREAKS)

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:13.369
<i>Fuck!</i>

00:02:17.625 --> 00:02:20.444
<i>Despite what you may have heard,</i>

00:02:21.236 --> 00:02:24.053
<i>HRAs are not monitoring devices.</i>

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:26.391
<i>We are not tracking your movements...</i>

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:27.397
<i>Or...</i>

00:02:27.421 --> 00:02:31.600
<i>...listening to your conversations
while you're wearing them.</i>

00:02:33.775 --> 00:02:38.576
<i>We do that regardless of whether or not
you're wearing an HRA.</i>

00:02:40.942 --> 00:02:43.094
<i>Think of them as a...</i>

00:02:45.121 --> 00:02:47.687
<i>As a... life preserver.</i>

00:02:47.871 --> 00:02:52.501
<i>Only instead of water, the thing HRA
protects you from is... um...</i>

00:02:52.952 --> 00:02:54.558
<i>...classified.</i>

00:02:55.222 --> 00:02:59.401
<i>One day, that classified
not-water might pour in and...</i>

00:03:00.456 --> 00:03:04.329
<i>...you'll be glad you've got an HRA
keeping you afloat.</i>

00:03:05.252 --> 00:03:07.618
<i>And if you don't have an HRA...</i>

00:03:08.147 --> 00:03:09.545
<i>...don't worry.</i>

00:03:09.568 --> 00:03:10.928
<i>It'll be... uh...</i>

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.165
<i>...quick and painless.</i>

00:03:13.206 --> 00:03:14.407
<i>(CHUCKLES)</i>

00:03:14.436 --> 00:03:15.436
<i>Kidding.</i>

00:03:16.982 --> 00:03:18.412
<i>I'm kidding.</i>

00:03:18.875 --> 00:03:21.347
<i>We're making more.</i>

00:04:11.484 --> 00:04:13.916
- TRENCH: <i>Impossibly changing labyrinth.</i>

00:04:15.123 --> 00:04:17.313
<i>Can ever pass through.</i>

00:04:18.493 --> 00:04:20.870
<i>Dimensional Research.</i>

00:04:22.117 --> 00:04:24.669
<i>Every measure of security.</i>

00:04:40.531 --> 00:04:41.610
- AHTI: <i>Broke.</i>

00:04:41.649 --> 00:04:44.593
<i>Contact the janitor
if you need to get through.</i>

00:04:45.225 --> 00:04:46.614
- JESSE: <i>Broken?</i>

00:04:46.714 --> 00:04:49.247
<i>How many dead ends
can this place have?</i>

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.133
<i>We need to find Ahti...</i>
